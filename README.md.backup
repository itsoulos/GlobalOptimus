# The Optimus optimization package
This projects proposes a programming tool written in ANSI C+ for global optimization problems. The main components of the software are: a) Coding of the objective problem in a high level language such as ANSI C++ b) Incorporation of many global optimization techniques to tackle the objective problem c)Parameterization of global optimization methods using user-defined parameters.
#  Requirements
1. A C++ compiler (GNU GCC is recommended).
2. The GNU make utility
3. The OpenMP programming library
4. The QT programming library.
## Linux/Openbsd installation
The steps to install the software in most Unix systems are
1. Download the Qt library (usually using the package manager of the distribution)
2. Unzip the software: guznip GlobalOptimus-master.zip
3. Issue the command: cd GlobalOptimus-master
4. Issue the command: qmake (or qmake-qt5 in some systems)
5. Issue the command: make

## Windows installation
On Windows a simple solution for the installation could be the following steps:
1. Install the software installer Choco 
2. Issue the command: choco install make
3. Issue the command: choco install mingw
4. Install the Qt library
4. Unzip the software
5. Issue the command cd GlobalOptimus-master
6. Issue the command qmake
7. Issue the command make
Alternatively, in Windows the user can use the added Setup msi executable and issue the following:

1. Install the package 
2. 

## Available Global Optimization methods
The implemented Global Optimization methods are:
1. The Differential Evolution denoted as DifferentialEvolution.
2. The Parallel Differential Evolution method (utilizing the OpenMP library), denoted as ParallelDe.
3. A genetic algorithm, denoted as Genetic in the package.
4. An improved version of the Particle Swarm Optimizer, denoted as iPSO
5. A simple Multistart method, which initiates many local optimization procedures to discover the global optimum of a function.
6. The NeuralMinimizer method, which constructs an estimated function of the objective problem using Neural Networks.
7. A parallel Particle Swarm Optimizer (using the OpenMP library), denoted as ParallelPso
8. A Simulated Annealing optimizer, denoted as Simman

## Available Local Optimization methods
All global optimization methods can be enhanced by applying a local minimization method after they are terminated. The parameter used to determine the used local optimization procedure is the --opt_localsearch parameter. The implemented local optimization methods are the following:
1. The bfgs method. The Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) algorithm was implemented using a variant of Powell.
2. The limited memory BFGS method (lbfgs).
3. The Gradient descent method. This method is denoted as gradient.
4. The Nelder Mead method (denoted as nelderMead).
5. The Adam optimizer (denoted as adam).

## The script runfunmin.sh
It is a scrip to simplify the optimization tasks, used in Unix environments. A similar script for Windows environments is called runfunmin.bat
