# Summary
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The location of global minima is applied in a variety of problems derived from physics [@duan1992effective_1992], chemistry [@liwo1999protein_1999], medicine [@lee2007large_2007], etc. Also, global optimization can be used in complex problems, such as the training of neural networks [@chiroma2017neural_2017]. Methods used in the global optimization process can be divided into stochastic and deterministic and  a comparison between methods of these categories can be found in the work of @sergeyev2018efficiency_2018. This article proposes a software package that incorporates a variety of stochastic methods to handle the optimization of multidimensional functions.

# Statement of need
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This paper presents the `GlobalOptimus` software,  written in ANSI C++, which allows researchers wanting to solve optimization problems in their domain to formulate their optimization problems and apply different global optimization methods to identify the global minimum of the problem. The main features of the software are: a) Coding of the objective problem in a high level language such as ANSI C++, b) Incorporation of many global optimization techniques to solve the objective problem, c) Parameterization of global optimization methods using user-defined parameters, and d) Usage of a GUI application to control the optimization strategy.
<br>
Some of the frequently used optimization tools are MATLAB Optimization Toolbox, SciPy optimization module and Gurobi. MATLAB and SciPy are usually based on high-level languages, which can limit performance when computational problems are required.
<br>
GlobalOptimus is an algorithmic optimization tool written in C++, which combines high performance with ease of parameterization for solving optimization problems in various domains. Unlike other tools, it stands out for its open architecture and adaptability, allowing full customization and integration of software from other platforms without restrictions. In addition, GlobalOptimus supports multiple optimization algorithms, such as genetic algorithms and differential evolution, giving flexibility in formulating the optimal method for each problem. Although both MATLAB and SciPy offer support for such algorithms, GlobalOptimus provides one extensible approach.
Finally, Gurobi is an extremely powerful tool for mathematical optimization, but it requires a commercial license. Instead, GlobalOptimus is open source, which makes it more accessible to researchers and developers who wish to adapt it to their needs.
</p>

# Usage of the Software 
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The software is compiled using the QT library, available from  the [Qt website](https://qt.io) The researcher should code their objective function and a number of other mandatory functions in the C++ programming language, specifying the dimension of the objective function and the bounds of the function domain. Subsequently, they can select a global optimization method to apply to the problem from a wide range of available methods.</p>

In addition, the user can create their own objective function by implementing the methods of category `UserProblem`,
the methods of which are presented in the following diagram.

#  Conclusions
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this work, an environment for executing global optimization problems was presented, where the user can implement their optimization problem using a set of predefined functions and then has the possibility to choose among several global optimization methods to solve the defined problem. In addition, it is given the possibility to choose to use a local optimization method to enhance the reliability of the produced results. This programming environment is freely available and easy to extend to accommodate more global optimization techniques.
