# Summary
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The location of global minimum founds application in a variety of problems derived from physics [@duan1992effective_1992], chemistry [@liwo1999protein_1999], medicine [@lee2007large_2007] etc. Also, the global optimization process can be used in complex problems, such as the training of neural networks [@chiroma2017neural_2017]. Methods used in the global optimization process can be divided into stochastic and deterministic, and  a comparison between methods of these categories can be found in the work of Sergeyev et al.[@sergeyev2018efficiency_2018]. This article proposes a software that incorporates a variety of stochastic methods to handle optimization methods of multidimensional functions.

# Statement of need
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This paper presents the `GlobalOptimus` software tool,  written in ANSI C++, which researchers can use to formulate the problem to be solved and then apply the required global optimization method identify the global minimum of the problem. The main features of the suggested software are: a) Coding of the objective problem in a high level language such as ANSI C++ b) Incorporation of many global optimization techniques to tackle the objective problem c)Parameterization of global optimization methods using user-defined parameters d) Usage of a GUI application to control the optimization strategy.
</p>

##  Software 
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The software can be compiled using the QT library, available from  https://qt.io. The researcher should code the objective function and a number of other mandatory functions in the C++ programming language. Also, the researcher should provide the dimension of the objective function as well as the bound of the function. Subsequently, the user can select a global optimization method to apply to the problem from a wide range of available methods.</p>

## Implemented global optimization methods
<p style="text-align: justify?">
 In the proposed software, each implemented global optimization method has a set of parameters that can determine the overall optimization path and the effectiveness of the method. Some of the global optimization methods are as follows: </p>

#  Conclusions
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In this work, an environment for executing global optimization problems was presented. In this environment, the user can code the objective problem using some predefined functions and then has the possibility to choose one among several global optimization methods to solve the mentioned problem. In addition, it is given the possibility to choose to use some local optimization method to enhance the reliability of the produced results. This programming environment is freely available and easy to extend to accommodate more global optimization techniques.
