\begin_layout Abstract
Global optimization is used in many practical and scientific problems.
 For this reason, various computational techniques have been developed.
 Particularly important are the evolutionary techniques, which simulate
 natural phenomena with the aim of detecting the global minimum in complex
 problems.
 A new evolutionary method is the Eel and Grouper Optimization (EGO) algorithm,
 inspired by the symbiotic relationship and foraging strategy of eels and
 groupers in marine ecosystems.
 In this work, modifications of this technique are proposed, such as the
 use of a termination technique based on stochastic observations.
 The proposed modifications have been tested on multidimensional functions
 available from the relevant literature and compared with other evolutionary
 methods.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic goal of global optimization is to find the global minimum by searching
 for the appropriate scope of the underlying objective problem.
 Primarily, a global optimization method aims to discover the global minimum
 of a continuous multidimensional function, and it is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x^{*}=\mbox{arg}\min_{x\in S}f(x)\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S=\left[a_{1},b_{1}\right]\times\left[a_{2},b_{2}\right]\times\ldots\left[a_{n},b_{n}\right]

 Global optimization is a technique of vital importance in many fields of
 science and applications, as it allows finding the optimal solution to
 problems with multiple local solutions.

 Recently, Sergeyev et al

An important branch of the stochastic methods are the evolutionary methods,

 Among these methods one can find the Differential Evolution method

Among the evolutionary techniques one finds a large group of methods that
 have been explored intensively in recent years, the so - called Swarm Intellige

 Swarm intelligence algorithms 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 are inspired by the collective behavior of insects and other animals.
 These algorithms mimic systems in which agents interact locally and cooperate
 worldwide to solve optimization problems.
 Swarm intelligence algorithms are very important tools for dealing with
 complex optimization problems in a wide range of applications

 consider that target ingestion, something observed in eels and groupers,
 is a necessary condition for interspecific cooperative hunting to occur.
 Intraspecific predation could increase the hunting efficiency of predators
 by mammals.
 According to Ali Mohammadzadeh and Seyedali Mirjalili the EGO optimization
 algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Eel and grouper optimizer"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 generates a set of random answers, then stores the best answers found so
 far, allocates them to the target point, and changes the answers with them.
 As the number of iterations increases, the limits of the sine function
 are changed to enhance the phase of finding the best solution.
 This method stops the process when the iteration exceeds the maximum number.
 Because the EGO optimization algorithm generates and boosts a collection
 of random responses, it has the advantage of increased local optimum discovery
 and avoidance compared to individual methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper introduces some modifications to the EGO algorithm in order to
 improve its efficiency.
 The proposed amendments are presented below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The addition of a sampling technique based on the K-means method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "MacQueen"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The sampling points will facilitate finding the global minimum of the function
 in the most efficient way.
 Additionally, by applying this method, nearby points are discarded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Using a termination technique that is developed with random measurements.
 Each time the algorithm is repeated, the minimum value is recorded.
 When this remains constant for a predetermined number of iterations, the
 process is terminated.
 Therefore, the method will complete in time without unnecessarily wasting
 time in iterations, avoiding unnecessary consumption of computing resources.

The main steps of the algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
EGO optimization algorithm starts by initializing a population consisting
 of "search agents" that search to find the optimal solution.
 At each iteration, the position of the "prey" (optimal solution) is calculated.
 Agent positions are adjusted based on random variables and their distance
 based on the optimal position.At the end of each iteration, the current
 solutions are compared and it is decided whether the algorithm should continue
 or terminate.

\begin_layout Standard
The sampling technique applied in this work initially generates samples
 from the objective function.
 Then, through the K-means method, only the recognized centers are selected
 as final samples.
 This technique, which is an achievement of James MacQueen 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "MacQueen"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, is one of the most well-known clustering algorithms in the broad research
 community, both in data analysis and in machine learning 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

literal "false"

\end_inset

 and pattern recognition 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 The algorithm aims to divide a data set into k clusters.
 The K-means algorithm tries to divide the data into groups in such a way
 that the internal points of each group are as close as possible to each
 other.
 At the same time, he tries to place the central points of each group in
 positions which are as representative as possible for the points of their
 group.
 During the past years a series of variants of this algorithm has been proposed,
 such as the Genetic K-means algotithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gen_kmeans"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, the unsupervised K-means algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, the Fixed-centered K-means algorithm

 All experiments were conducted 30 times using different seed for the random
 generator and averages were recorded.
 The used software was coded in ANSI C++ using the freely available OPTIMUS
 optimization environment, that is available from

\begin_layout Standard
The article proposed some modifications to the EEGO optimization method,
 aimed at improving the overall performance and increasing the speed of
 the global optimization algorithm.
 The first modification concerns the application of a sampling technique
 based on the K-Means method.
 This technique allowed us to significantly minimize the number of function
 calls to find the global minimum and further improved the accuracy with
 which it is located.
 In particular, the application of the K-Means method accelerated the finding
 of a solution, as it more efficiently located the points of interest in
 the search space and led to the fastest convergence to the global minimum.
 Compared to other methods based on random distributions, the proposed technique
 proved its superiority, especially in multidimensional and complex functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second proposed amendment concerns the termination rule based on similarity
 of solutions during iterations.
 The main purpose of this rule is to stop the optimization process when
 the iterated solutions are too close to each other, thus preventing pointless
 iterations that do not provide any significant improvement.
 It therefore avoids wasting computing time in cases where the process is
 already very close to the desired result.
 The use of the termination rule significantly improves the efficiency of
 the algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, other modifications were proposed in the article, which help
 to reduce the number of function calls and increase the success rate of
 the algorithm.
 These modifications enhanced the efficiency of the EEGO algorithm, making
 it more efficient in a wide range of optimization problems.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental results presented in the article were particularly encouraging.
 Therefore, the proposed method can be applied in various fields.
 The increased speed and improved accuracy of the optimization process make
 it suitable for a wide range of applications in fields such as machine
 learning and artificial intelligence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A future direction suggested for further improvement of the method is the
 utilization of parallel computing systems to speed up the optimization
 process.
 Examples of such systems are the use of MPI technology
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "MPI"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 or the integration of the OpenMP library
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "OPENMP"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which allows multithreaded execution of the algorithm on modern multicore
 systems.
 This perspective can lead to a significant speed improvement of the EEGO
 method, making it even more effective and efficient for applications that
 require high computing power.
