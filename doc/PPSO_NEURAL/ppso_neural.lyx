\begin_layout Abstract
Artificial neural networks constitute a machine learning tool that has been used across a wide range of scientific as well as commercial applications over the past decades,
 delivering excellent results in most cases.
 For the effective training of the parameters of these machine learning models,
 optimization techniques are employed;
 however,
 in most cases these techniques tend to require significant computational time,
 which is also determined by the complexity and the size of the data to which the artificial neural network is applied.
 In the present work,
 a computational method is presented that exploits modern parallel computing architectures and is based on a distributed variant of the Particle Swarm Optimization technique.
 This method also employs distributed initialization of the artificial neural network parameters to enable more effective exploration of the parameter value space of the machine learning model.
 Furthermore,
 experimental results indicate that the proposed method becomes more effective as the number of parallel computational units increases,
 thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the technique.In this study,
 the technique was applied to a large dataset originating from various scientific domains,
 and the experimental results were more than promising.

 Typically,
 a neural network is defined as a function 
\begin_inset Formula $N(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w})$
\end_inset

,
 where the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

 denotes the input pattern and the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$
\end_inset

 represents the weight vector,
 that should be estimated by some optimization procedure.
 The estimation of this vector is commonly achieved by minimizing the so-called training error,
 defined mathematically as :
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E(\overrightarrow{w})=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x}_{i},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,...,M$
\end_inset

 represents the associated training set of the current problem.
 The values 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 denote the desired output for each pattern 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x_{i}}$
\end_inset

.
 As proposed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nnc"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 a neural network can be formulated as the following function:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)}\sigma\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{j}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)+j}+w_{(d+2)i}\right)\label{eq:nn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this equation,
 the constant number 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 denotes the number of used processing units.
 Moreover,
 the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)$
\end_inset

 is the sigmoid function,
 expressed as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}\label{eq:sig}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

From equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 is deduced that
\series bold

the total number of parameters for neural network is 
\begin_inset Formula $n=(d+2)H$
\end_inset

.

Also,
 a a series of alternative activation functions has been proposed,
 such as the 
\begin_inset Formula $\tanh$
\end_inset

 function,
 which is formulated as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mbox{tanh}\left(x\right)=\frac{e^{2x}+1}{e^{2x}-1}
\end{equation}

A major problem encountered in artificial neural network training techniques is the increased completion time of these methods,
 which directly depends on the number of available patterns in the training set and the number of features in each data set.
 A series of publications have appeared in the recent literature that propose parallel techniques for optimizing the parameters of the artificial neural network.
 For example,
 Lotrič et al proposed a parallel implementation of neural networks using the MPI library 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "MPI"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 in their work 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Likewise,
 Gonzalez et al proposed a parallel implementation of an evolutionary approach that utilizes the MPI method,
 for the evolution of artificial neural networks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "eann_parallell"

\end_inset

.
 Additionally,
 Gu et all introduced the cNeural 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "cneural"

\end_inset

,
 a parallel computing platform to train neural networks using the Back Propagation method.
 A survey on the parallelization of neural network using various parallel techniques can be found in the recent work of Chanthini et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper,
 the use of a parallel optimization technique for the parameters of the artificial neural network is proposed,
 which is based on the widely used Particle Swarm Optimization method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "pso_major"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the proposed optimization method,
 the initial population of particles is divided into small populations and in each subpopulation a modified version of the PSO technique is executed.
 Each population is evolved on a separate processing thread.
 In this modified version,
 a stochastic technique for calculating the inertia coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is used,
 as well as a termination technique based on stochastic observations.
 The individual populations exchange the best individuals with each other after a predetermined number of iterations to accelerate the evolutionary process.
 The Particle Swarm Optimization method was chosen in this work due to the small number of parameters required but also for its efficiency and speed in finding the global minimum of functions.

\begin_layout Subsection
The PSO method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method originates from the observations made by Eberhart and Kennedy during the 1990s.
 By closely examining the collective behavior of birds searching for food,
 they developed a global optimization technique that draws on insights gained from these natural phenomena.
 In the proposed framework,
 particles move within the search space of the problem with the objective of locating the minimum of a given objective function.
 Each particle is characterized by two fundamental attributes:
 its current position and its velocity of movement.
 The current position is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

,
 while the velocity is represented by 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{u}$
\end_inset

.
 Moreover,
 each particle retains in memory the best position it has previously encountered—
corresponding to the lowest value of the objective function—
as well as the best position identified by the entire swarm.
 The optimization process proceeds iteratively,
 with particle positions at each iteration being updated based on their current positions,
 their personal best positions,
 and the global best position of the population.

Owing to its conceptual simplicity and the limited number of parameters that need to be tuned,
 this method has been successfully applied to a wide range of challenging problems across various scientific disciplines.
 Such problems encompass applications arising in physics

\begin_layout Subsection
Proposed modifications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The original Particle Swarm Optimization technique was extended using two modifications recently proposed by Charilogis et al 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ipso"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and aimed at more efficiently finding the global minimum of a function and at early termination of the technique.
 The first modification proposes a stochastic calculation for the inertia using the following formula:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\omega_{\mbox{k}}=0.5+\frac{r}{2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this equation the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 denotes the iteration number of the PSO method and the value 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 represents a random number in 
\begin_inset Formula $r\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 Additionally,
 a termination rule is proposed where the algorithm computes at every iteration 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 the quantity:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\delta^{(k)}=\left|f_{\mbox{min}}^{(k)}-f_{\mbox{min}}^{(k-1)}\right|\label{eq:term}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The value 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{\mbox{min}}^{(k)}$
\end_inset

 represents the best function value obtained by the algorithm at at iteration 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 If the aforementioned quantity remains below a predefined threshold 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{E}$
\end_inset

 consecutive iterations,
 the execution of the algorithm is terminated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\end_inset

.
 The proposed parallel algorithm divides the problem into a series of algorithms that are executed on different computing units.
 At regular intervals,
 these individual algorithms share the particles with the best value \SpecialChar allowbreak
found with the rest,
 in order to accelerate the evolutionary process but also to keep the individual algorithms informed about the best solutions found by others.

\begin_layout Standard
The Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 reports classification error rates (%) per dataset and per method.
 Each cell represents the empirical frequency of misclassification for a given dataset under the adopted experimental protocol;
 within each row,
 lower values indicate better generalization.
 The AVERAGE row provides an aggregate view across heterogeneous datasets,
 effectively summarizing the expected error when selecting a dataset from this benchmark set and applying the corresponding method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A clear global trend is that PPSO improves as the number of threads increases:
 27.45% (
\begin_inset Formula $T=1$
\end_inset

) → 24.30% (
\begin_inset Formula $T=2$
\end_inset

) → 23.10% (
\begin_inset Formula $T=4$
\end_inset

) → 22.19% (
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

).
 This is consistent with the behavior of parallel stochastic optimization,
 where additional threads typically enhance exploration diversity (e.g.,
 multiple initializations and search trajectories) and reduce the probability of converging to poor local minima.
 The gains also exhibit diminishing returns:
 the step from 
\begin_inset Formula $T=1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $T=2$
\end_inset

 yields the largest improvement,
 whereas the additional benefit from 
\begin_inset Formula $T=4$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

 is smaller,
 suggesting that beyond a point the search either saturates the solution space adequately or becomes limited by practical factors such as noise,
 synchronization/communication,
 and the effective allocation of the evaluation budget.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relative to the baselines,
 PPSO at 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

 achieves a substantially lower average error:
 22.19% versus 28.65% for GEN (a reduction of 6.46 percentage points,
 approximately a 22.5% relative decrease),
 37.38% for BFGS (approximately a 40.7% relative decrease),
 and 32.49% for RBF (approximately a 31.7% relative decrease).
 Interpreted scientifically,
 this indicates that the proposed approach more consistently identifies higher-quality parameterizations (e.g.,
 network weights) that translate into improved predictive performance across a broad and diverse benchmark suite.
 The especially large gap versus BFGS is aligned with the non-convex,
 multi-modal nature of neural training objectives,
 where gradient-based local methods can become trapped,
 while population-based stochastic strategies retain greater capacity to escape suboptimal basins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the dataset level,
 two main patterns emerge.
 First,
 there are datasets where PPSO delivers very large improvements (e.g.,
 DERMATOLOGY,
 WDBC,
 WINE,
 ALCOHOL,
 SEGMENT,
 OPTDIGITS),
 suggesting that optimization difficulty is a primary bottleneck and that enhanced distributed exploration yields markedly better solutions.
 Second,
 there are datasets where differences are small or not strictly monotone with thread count,
 and in a few cases a baseline is marginally competitive (e.g.,
 SATIMAGE for RBF,
 or datasets where GEN/RBF already achieve very low error).
 Such cases typically reflect performance saturation on easier tasks,
 stronger inductive bias of a particular model family,
 or stochastic variability and hyperparameter interactions that can produce minor reversals (e.g.,
 T=4 slightly better than T=10 on some rows) without contradicting the overall downward trend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key interpretive point is that the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 captures not only “optimization strength” but also the interaction between the optimizer,
 the underlying modeling assumptions,
 and the way computational budget is distributed.
 If the total number of evaluations (or total time) is held constant across thread counts,
 the improvement with larger 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 indicates a genuine efficiency gain from distributed exploration.
 If the total budget increases with 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

,
 then the observed gains also reflect increased computational effort.
 In either case,
 the results demonstrate that PPSO is competitive across a wide range of datasets and that increased parallelism shifts the error profile toward consistently lower values,
 which is the intended outcome of a parallel stochastic training procedure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 statistical processing was carried out via R scripts in order to quantify the significance of performance differences between the proposed PPSO method and the baseline approaches (BFGS,
 GEN,
 RBF) across different thread counts.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:statExpers"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 summarizes the resulting significance levels using the critical p-value criterion,
 following the standard categories ns (
\begin_inset Formula $p>0.05$
\end_inset

),
 significant (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.05$
\end_inset

),
 highly significant (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.01$
\end_inset

),
 extremely significant (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.001$
\end_inset

),
 and very extremely significant (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.0001$
\end_inset

).
 The global comparison across all methods is overwhelmingly significant:
 the overall Friedman test yields 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2.2\times10^{-16}$
\end_inset

,
 which strongly rejects the null hypothesis of equivalent performance and confirms that genuine differences exist among the evaluated methods over the full dataset collection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the level of pairwise comparisons by thread count,
 a clear strengthening of statistical evidence is observed as 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 increases.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $T=1$
\end_inset

,
 PPSO does not differ significantly from BFGS (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.6371$
\end_inset

),
 GEN (
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

),
 or RBF (
\begin_inset Formula $p=1$
\end_inset

),
 indicating that with a single thread the observed performance differences cannot be distinguished from dataset-to-dataset variability under the adopted experimental conditions.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $T=2$
\end_inset

,
 the situation changes:
 PPSO shows a highly robust advantage over BFGS (
\begin_inset Formula $p=1.01\times10^{-6}$
\end_inset

),
 whereas comparisons against GEN (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.2124$
\end_inset

) and RBF (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.1312$
\end_inset

) remain non-significant.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $T=4$
\end_inset

,
 the evidence further intensifies:
 against BFGS the p-value is 
\begin_inset Formula $1.37\times10^{-10}$
\end_inset

 (very extremely significant),
 while PPSO also becomes statistically superior to GEN (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.0035$
\end_inset

,
 highly/extremely significant) and to RBF (
\begin_inset Formula $p=9.57\times10^{-4}$
\end_inset

,
 extremely significant).
 Finally,
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

,
 PPSO exhibits very strong statistical superiority against all three baselines,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2.46\times10^{-13}$
\end_inset

 versus BFGS,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1.33\times10^{-5}$
\end_inset

 versus GEN,
 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1.97\times10^{-6}$
\end_inset

 versus RBF,
 corresponding to extremely to very extremely significant differences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 these findings indicate that increasing the number of threads not only improves PPSO’s average accuracy but also turns this improvement into a consistent and statistically defensible advantage over established baselines across a broad suite of classification datasets.
 The lack of significance at 
\begin_inset Formula $T=1$
\end_inset

 suggests that,
 under limited parallelism,
 the stochastic gains are not sufficiently strong to dominate inter-dataset variability.
 In contrast,
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $T\ge2$
\end_inset

 PPSO first establishes a clear advantage over BFGS,
 and as 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 increases to 4 and 10 this advantage extends to GEN and RBF as well,
 supporting the conclusion that distributed search substantially enhances PPSO’s ability to locate higher-quality training solutions and achieve better generalization.

\begin_layout Subsection
Experiments with the propagation method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally,
 another experiment was conducted where two different techniques for propagating the best particles between processing threads were used.
 On the one hand,
 the present technique,
 which is referred to in the experiment as 
\begin_inset Formula $NxN$
\end_inset

,
 and on the other hand,
 another propagation technique,
 entitled 
\begin_inset Formula $1x1$
\end_inset

,
 where a random processing thread is selected after a predetermined number of iterations to send its best particles to another randomly selected processing thread.
 The experimental results for the cases of four processing threads (
\begin_inset Formula $T=4)$
\end_inset

 and ten processing threads (
\begin_inset Formula $T=10)$
\end_inset

 are presented in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expersProp"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expersProp"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 reports classification error rates (%) for the proposed model trained/optimized with PPSO under four configurations that combine two factors:
 the level of parallelism (
\begin_inset Formula $T=4$
\end_inset

 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

 threads) and the information-propagation scheme among parallel workers (1to1 vs NtoN).
 Each cell is an empirical estimate of generalization for a given dataset:
 lower percentages indicate fewer misclassifications and therefore better predictive performance.
 Consequently,
 each row can be interpreted as a localized study of how parallel search capacity and communication intensity influence the quality of the final trained solution on that specific classification task.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The AVERAGE row provides an aggregated view over a heterogeneous benchmark suite.
 In this Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expersProp"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

 with 1to1 propagation yields the best mean error (22.11%),
 followed by 
\begin_inset Formula $T=4$
\end_inset

 with 1to1 (22.96%),
 while the NtoN variants exhibit higher average error (24.30% for 
\begin_inset Formula $T=4$
\end_inset

,
 NtoN and 23.10% for 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

,
 NtoN).
 This ordering does not imply that 1to1 is universally superior to NtoN,
 but rather that,
 across this collection of datasets,
 the more restrained propagation scheme more frequently leads to better end solutions.
 From a distributed optimization perspective,
 this is consistent with a well-known trade-off:
 stronger propagation (NtoN) can accelerate convergence by rapidly homogenizing information across workers,
 but it can also reduce search diversity and increase the risk of premature convergence to suboptimal regions.
 In contrast,
 more selective propagation (1to1) preserves greater independence across threads,
 maintains alternative promising trajectories for longer,
 and often improves the final generalization outcome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of increasing the number of threads is not uniform across datasets,
 which is expected.
 Moving from 
\begin_inset Formula $T=4$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

 typically increases coverage of the solution space by enabling more independent search trajectories and a richer set of initializations.
 This tends to be particularly beneficial when the optimization landscape is highly multi-modal or when training is sensitive to initialization.
 In the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expersProp"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 there are clear cases where 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

 substantially improves performance,
 such as OPTDIGITS (38.30% vs 48.13% for 1to1),
 WINE (13.00% vs 16.53% for 1to1),
 ZO_NF_S (7.52% vs 11.44% for 1to1),
 and STATHEART (20.87% vs 22.22% for 1to1).
 These patterns indicate that additional parallel exploration more reliably discovers parameterizations that generalize better.
 At the same time,
 there are datasets where the difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T=4$
\end_inset

 is small or slightly reversed (e.g.,
 ALCOHOL,
 BEED,
 SONAR).
 Such behavior typically reflects either performance saturation (
\begin_inset Formula $T=4$
\end_inset

 already explores sufficiently),
 or stochastic variability and configuration-dependent synchronization/communication effects that produce different but not consistently better solutions on that dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The comparison between 1to1 and NtoN is also dataset-dependent.
 In many rows,
 1to1 has a clear advantage,
 for example HEART (20.37% vs 22.11% at 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

),
 OPTDIGITS (38.30% vs 46.41% at 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

),
 and WDBC (5.55% vs 6.11% at 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

).
 These cases are consistent with the interpretation that NtoN can drive all threads too quickly toward a shared basin of attraction that is not optimal for generalization,
 especially when multiple competing parameter regions yield similar training quality but different test behavior.
 However,
 there are also datasets where NtoN appears beneficial,
 such as SEGMENT at 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

 (21.49% vs 23.85% for 1to1) and PIRVISION (6.26% at 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

,
 NtoN vs 7.72% at 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

,
 1to1),
 suggesting that,
 for certain tasks,
 faster collective exploitation of a strong solution region can be advantageous when the landscape is less deceptive or when the best region is strongly attracting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Importantly,
 the fact that no single configuration dominates every dataset is scientifically meaningful and expected.
 Datasets differ in noise level,
 dimensionality and feature correlations,
 nonlinearity,
 and class separability,
 all of which shape the error landscape being optimized.
 As a result,
 parallelism and propagation act as regulators of the exploration–exploitation balance and can steer PPSO toward solutions with better average generalization,
 while individual datasets may favor different balances.
 Overall,
 the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expersProp"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 demonstrates that thread count and propagation strategy are not merely implementation details but materially affect the generalization quality of the proposed model.
 The best mean performance of 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

 with 1to1 propagation suggests that,
 for this benchmark suite,
 higher parallelism is most effective when coupled with controlled information exchange that preserves diversity and mitigates premature convergence,
 whereas NtoN can still be competitive on specific datasets where rapid collective exploitation is advantageous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:statPropagation"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 reports the significance levels of performance differences among PPSO variants with respect to the propagation mechanism (1to1 versus NtoN) under two parallelism settings (
\begin_inset Formula $T=4$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

).
 The interpretation relies on the critical p-value and the standard significance categories ns (
\begin_inset Formula $p>0.05$
\end_inset

),
 significant (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.05$
\end_inset

),
 highly significant (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.01$
\end_inset

),
 extremely significant (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.001$
\end_inset

),
 and very extremely significant (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.0001$
\end_inset

).
 The overall multi-method comparison indicates that meaningful differences exist across the evaluated PPSO configurations,
 as the global Friedman test yields 
\begin_inset Formula $4.28\times10^{-6}$
\end_inset

,
 thereby rejecting the null hypothesis of equal performance among variants over the full suite of classification datasets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the pairwise level,
 the comparison between PPSO (
\begin_inset Formula $T=4$
\end_inset

,
 1to1) and PPSO (
\begin_inset Formula $T=4$
\end_inset

,
 NtoN) produces 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.0236$
\end_inset

,
 which is statistically significant under the conventional 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.05$
\end_inset

 criterion.
 This result implies that,
 at a moderate parallelism level (4 threads),
 the choice of propagation scheme systematically affects the performance of the proposed model across datasets,
 and the observed differences are unlikely to be explained solely by random dataset-to-dataset variability.
 In contrast,
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

 the comparison between PPSO (
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

,
 1to1) and PPSO (
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

,
 NtoN) yields 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.0567$
\end_inset

,
 which lies slightly above the 0.05 threshold and is therefore classified as non-significant (ns) under that cutoff.
 This near-threshold value suggests a tendency for differentiation between the two propagation schemes at 10 threads,
 but the available empirical evidence is not strong enough to support the same level of statistical confidence as in the 
\begin_inset Formula $T=4$
\end_inset

 case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 these findings support the conclusion that the propagation mechanism can materially influence the performance of the proposed PPSO training scheme,
 particularly at moderate parallelism (
\begin_inset Formula $T=4$
\end_inset

),
 whereas at higher parallelism (
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

) the differences appear weaker or less stable across the heterogeneous dataset collection.
 From an interpretive standpoint,
 this is consistent with the notion that increasing the number of threads already enhances search diversity and may partially absorb the effect of propagation,
 reducing the net separability between 1to1 and NtoN when performance is aggregated across many diverse classification problems.

Experiments with the termination strategy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Furthermore,
 to determine the effectiveness of the proposed technique in relation to the termination strategy,
 another experiment was conducted in which the number of processing threads was set to 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

.
 In this experiment,
 the following termination strategies were used,
 as reflected in the relevant table with the results (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:termination"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ANY.
 In this case,
 the method terminates when the termination rule is applied to one of the processing threads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
MAJORITY.
 In this case,
 the optimization method terminates when the predefined termination rule applies to the majority of processing threads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
ALL.
 In this case,
 termination is successful when the termination rule applies to all processing threads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:termination"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 compares three termination policies applied to the same proposed PPSO-based training/optimization procedure across a suite of classification datasets,
 using classification error (%) as the evaluation criterion.
 The columns ANY,
 MAJORITY,
 and ALL do not correspond to different models;
 instead,
 they implement different rules for deciding when the parallel procedure is considered “finished” and which outcome is accepted as final.
 Therefore,
 each cell reflects the generalization performance of the same underlying model when only the termination/synchronization logic is changed.
 This is important because it highlights that,
 even with a fixed optimizer,
 the decision policy can materially influence which solution is ultimately selected,
 effectively controlling how conservatively or aggressively the algorithm commits to a final set of parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The AVERAGE row indicates that the ALL policy achieves the lowest mean error (22.19%),
 followed by MAJORITY (22.74%) and ANY (22.99%).
 Although the differences are moderate,
 the ordering is consistent with a clear interpretation:
 ALL is the strictest rule,
 requiring completion (or convergence) of all parallel workers before finalizing the result.
 This tends to favor higher-quality solutions because it reduces the chance of stopping due to a single “lucky” or prematurely stabilized worker and allows slower but potentially more informative search trajectories to contribute.
 In contrast,
 ANY is the most aggressive rule,
 since the procedure can terminate as soon as one worker finishes,
 which can more often lead to premature commitment to solutions that are not optimal in terms of generalization.
 MAJORITY lies between these extremes by requiring agreement or completion from most workers,
 partially balancing decision speed with outcome stability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the dataset level,
 there is no universal dominance of a single policy in every row,
 yet ALL shows clear advantages on several challenging or highly variable tasks.
 For example,
 ALL produces noticeably lower errors on OPTDIGITS (41.97% versus 42.96% and 46.06%),
 SATIMAGE (40.84% versus 45.78% and 43.34%),
 SEGMENT (24.34% versus 25.68% and 25.94%),
 SONAR (20.85% versus 22.45% and 22.30%),
 and WDBC (5.36% versus 5.79% and 6.55%).
 This pattern aligns with the idea that,
 on difficult optimization landscapes where different workers may converge to substantially different solutions,
 waiting for all workers reduces the probability of selecting an inferior solution that simply appeared earlier.
 On the other hand,
 there are datasets where MAJORITY or ANY is marginally better (e.g.,
 BEED and LYMOGRAPHY for MAJORITY,
 or ALCOHOL where MAJORITY slightly outperforms ALL).
 These cases suggest that the added strictness of ALL does not always translate into improved generalization,
 particularly when the incremental benefit from the “late” workers is small or when extended search increases the risk of overfitting on certain datasets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conceptually,
 the three policies can be viewed as mechanisms that regulate the exploration–commitment trade-off in parallel stochastic search.
 ANY emphasizes fast commitment:
 if one worker quickly reaches a good region,
 the process stops early,
 which can be computationally efficient but more sensitive to random favorable or unfavorable outcomes.
 MAJORITY provides greater robustness by requiring collective confirmation from more workers,
 acting as a filter against isolated extreme behaviors.
 ALL is the most conservative and,
 according to the mean performance in the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:termination"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 tends to yield a more reliable selection of high-quality solutions because it fully exploits parallelism until completion.
 The observed improvement in the overall average suggests that,
 for this benchmark suite,
 the additional “patience” imposed by ALL more frequently translates into better generalization,
 especially on problems where ignoring slower workers means losing valuable alternative solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 the Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:termination"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 demonstrates that the termination policy is not a minor implementation detail but a mechanism that directly affects which solution is chosen by a parallel stochastic training procedure.
 Based on both the average values and the behavior on several difficult datasets,
 ALL appears to provide the most consistently high-quality outcomes,
 while ANY and MAJORITY can be viewed as alternatives that prioritize faster decisions or an intermediate balance,
 respectively,
 at the cost of slightly higher mean classification error.

Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 presents the significance levels of performance differences obtained by comparing three alternative termination policies of the same proposed PPSO procedure (ANY,
 MAJORITY,
 ALL) over a suite of classification datasets.
 Significance is interpreted via the p-value using the standard categories ns for 
\begin_inset Formula $p>0.05$
\end_inset

,
 significant for 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.05$
\end_inset

,
 highly significant for 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.01$
\end_inset

,
 extremely significant for 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.001$
\end_inset

,
 and very extremely significant for 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.0001$
\end_inset

.
 The three policies differ in when the parallel training process is considered complete and the final solution is accepted:
 ANY terminates when a single thread finishes,
 MAJORITY terminates when a predefined number or fraction of threads finish,
 and ALL terminates only when all threads finish.
 The analysis therefore tests whether the strictness of the termination rule systematically alters the final performance of the same model across different datasets.

\begin_inset Formula $p<0.01$
\end_inset

).
 This indicates that,
 when all three termination policies are considered jointly,
 the observed performance differences across the dataset suite are sufficiently consistent to reject the null hypothesis of equal performance.
 In other words,
 the termination policy is not a negligible implementation detail but a factor that can meaningfully influence the final classification error achieved by the proposed procedure.

At the same time,
 the reported pairwise comparisons do not reach statistical significance under the conventional 0.05 threshold.
 Specifically,
 PPSO (ANY) versus PPSO (MAJORITY) yields 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.1211$
\end_inset

 (non-significant),
 and PPSO (MAJORITY) versus PPSO (ALL) yields 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.5477$
\end_inset

 (also non-significant).
 This apparent discrepancy between a significant global test and non-significant pairwise contrasts is common in multi-method,
 heterogeneous dataset evaluations:
 a global test can detect that systematic differences exist somewhere among the methods,
 while individual pairwise tests may lack sufficient power to cross the same significance threshold,
 especially when differences are modest,
 unevenly distributed across datasets,
 and/or when multiple-comparison adjustments are applied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interpretively,
 these findings suggest that the termination rule affects PPSO’s overall behavior as a family of configurations,
 yet the specific pairwise contrasts reported here do not provide strong evidence of a uniform advantage of one policy over another across the full dataset suite.
 This aligns with the conceptual role of termination policies as regulators of the “fast commitment” versus “full parallel exploitation” trade-off:
 ANY emphasizes rapid completion with a higher risk of premature solution selection,
 ALL is more conservative and may stabilize the final choice by fully utilizing parallel search,
 and MAJORITY lies between these extremes.
 The significant overall Friedman result supports that this regulation matters at the aggregate level,
 even if the presented pairwise p-values are not sufficient,
 on their own,
 to establish a definitive ordering between those particular policy pairs under 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.05$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
This work showed that training the proposed machine learning model can be substantially improved when formulated as a stochastic optimization task and implemented through a parallel swarm execution.
 The classical PSO core is used with two explicit modifications,
 inertia computed according to Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

plural "false"
caps "false"

 and termination controlled by Equation

,
 so that the search dynamics become more controlled and less prone to premature stagnation.
 The parallel formulation then orchestrates multiple independent search trajectories and empirically demonstrates that increasing the number of threads acts as a reliability mechanism,
 because it increases the probability of locating better minima on the error landscape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Across a broad collection of classification datasets,
 the results indicate a consistent reduction in classification error as parallelism increases.
 The average error decreases from 27.45% with one thread to 22.19% with ten threads,
 reflecting a clear generalization gain and a diminishing returns pattern,
 since most benefits are already captured up to four threads and additional improvements become smaller thereafter.
 Relative to the reference methods,
 the best PPSO configuration achieves markedly lower mean error,
 corresponding to an approximately 40.6% reduction versus BFGS,
 approximately 22.5% versus GEN,
 and approximately 31.7% versus RBF,
 indicating that the advantage is not confined to isolated datasets but also holds at the aggregate level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The statistical evaluation further supports that these differences are not random.
 The overall Friedman test yields 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2.2\times10^{-16}$
\end_inset

,
 strongly rejecting performance equivalence.
 Moreover,
 the pairwise comparisons show that increasing thread count strengthens the consistency of the PPSO advantage against the baselines,
 with extremely small p values at higher parallelism levels.
 The propagation analysis suggests that the information exchange scheme can materially influence performance at moderate parallelism,
 where the difference between one to one and N to N is significant for four threads,
 while for ten threads it becomes borderline and less stable.
 Similarly,
 the termination policy analysis indicates that termination affects the overall behavior with a significant global effect,
 yet without a universal dominance in every pairwise contrast,
 which is consistent with termination acting mainly as a regulator of when and how the procedure commits to a final solution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A direct next step is to more strictly disentangle the effect of parallelism from the total computational budget,
 clarifying how much of the gain stems from improved exploration and how much from increased computational effort.
 In this context,
 systematic reporting of runtime,
 energy cost,
 and scalability is essential,
 together with the study of asynchronous communication protocols that reduce synchronization overhead and enable smoother exploitation of parallel resources.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition,
 propagation and termination can be upgraded to adaptive strategies that dynamically select one to one or N to N propagation and ANY,
 MAJORITY,
 or ALL termination based on stagnation indicators,
 solution diversity,
 and improvement rate.
 There is also clear potential for hybrid schemes that combine PPSO with local optimization,
 as well as for multiobjective training where,
 beyond error,
 complexity,
 stability,
 and interpretability are optimized.
 Finally,
 evaluation should be expanded to larger and more imbalanced datasets,
 online learning settings,
 and distribution shift scenarios,
 in order to substantiate robustness under real conditions and nonstationary data streams.
