\begin_layout Abstract
Artificial neural networks constitute a machine learning tool that has been used across a wide range of scientific as well as commercial applications over the past decades,
 delivering excellent results in most cases.
 For the effective training of the parameters of these machine learning models,
 optimization techniques are employed;
 however,
 in most cases these techniques tend to require significant computational time,
 which is also determined by the complexity and the size of the data to which the artificial neural network is applied.
 In the present work,
 a computational method is presented that exploits modern parallel computing architectures and is based on a distributed variant of the Particle Swarm Optimization technique.
 This method also employs distributed initialization of the artificial neural network parameters to enable more effective exploration of the parameter value space of the machine learning model.
 Furthermore,
 experimental results indicate that the proposed method becomes more effective as the number of parallel computational units increases,
 thereby enhancing the overall efficiency of the technique.In this study,
 the technique was applied to a large dataset originating from various scientific domains,
 and the experimental results were more than promising.

The code used in the current work was coded in the C++ language and the freely available Optimus environment 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 was used.
 All the experiments were repeated 30 times,
 using different seed for the random generator in every run.
 For the validation of the experimental results,
 the well - known procedure of ten - fold cross validation was incorporated.
 For the classification datasets the average classification error is reported,
 as calculated using the following formula:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{C}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=100\times\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\mbox{class}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)-y_{i}\right)}{N}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The set 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 represents the test set and it is defined as:
 
\begin_inset Formula $T=\left(x_{i},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,\ldots,N$
\end_inset

.
 The values for the experimental settings are depicted in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 The parameter values have been set so that there is a compromise between the efficiency and speed of the methodologies used when performing the experiments.
 The following notation is used in the experimental tables:

Experiments with the propagation method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally,
 another experiment was conducted where two different techniques for propagating the best particles between processing threads were used.
 On the one hand,
 the present technique,
 which is referred to in the experiment as 
\begin_inset Formula $NxN$
\end_inset

,
 and on the other hand,
 another propagation technique,
 entitled 
\begin_inset Formula $1x1$
\end_inset

,
 where a random processing thread is selected after a predetermined number of iterations to send its best particles to another randomly selected processing thread.
 The experimental results for the cases of four processing threads (
\begin_inset Formula $T=4)$
\end_inset

 and ten processing threads (
\begin_inset Formula $T=10)$
\end_inset

 are presented in Table

Experiments with the termination strategy

Furthermore,
 to determine the effectiveness of the proposed technique in relation to the termination strategy,
 another experiment was conducted in which the number of processing threads was set to 
\begin_inset Formula $T=10$
\end_inset

.
 In this experiment,
 the following termination strategies were used,
 as reflected in the relevant table with the results (Table

 In this case,
 the method terminates when the termination rule is applied to one of the processing threads.

 In this case,
 the optimization method terminates when the predefined termination rule applies to the majority of processing threads.
