\begin_layout Abstract
Global optimization represents a fundamental challenge in computer science and engineering,
 as it aims to identify high-quality solutions to problems spanning from moderate to extremely high dimensionality.
 The Differential Evolution algorithm (DE) is a population-based algorithm like genetic algorithms and uses similar operators such as:
 crossover,
 mutation and selection.
 The proposed method introduces a set of methodological enhancements designed to increase both the robustness and the computational efficiency of the classical The DE framework.
 Specifically,
 an adaptive termination criterion is incorporated,
 enabling early stopping based on statistical measures of convergence and population stagnation.
 Furthermore,
 a population sampling strategy based on k-means clustering is employed to enhance exploration and improve the redistribution of individuals in high-dimensional search spaces.
 This mechanism enables structured population renewal and effectively mitigates premature convergence.
 The enhanced algorithm was evaluated on standard large-scale numerical optimization benchmarks and compared with established global optimization methods.
 The experimental results indicate substantial improvements in convergence speed,
 scalability,
 and solution stability.

A particular challenge is the large-scale global optimization (LSGO) problem,
 where the complexity increases significantly with increasing problem dimensions.
 Finding efficient and computationally feasible solutions has become particularly difficult,
 which has led the research community to focus on the development of innovative algorithms.
 LSGO problems are encountered in a wide range of applications,
 while their importance is also reflected in the organization of the first global large-scale optimization competition within the framework of the CEC in 2008.
 Other competitions followed in 2010

DE is one of the most widely used optimization techniques,
 as it offers high robustness,
 simplicity and fast convergence.
 DE is a highly efficient evolutionary algorithm that has gained significant recognition since the late 1990s.
 DE,

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 has proven to be a versatile optimization tool that can be applied in various scientific and engineering fields.
 It is particularly effective for symmetric optimization problems,
 as well as for dealing with discontinuous,

 In physics,
 it has been used in energy-related problems,
 including wind power optimization

.
 Despite its effectiveness,
 classical DE may face additional challenges when applied to high-dimensional and large-scale optimization problems.
 In such settings,
 the adaptation of control parameters becomes more demanding,
 while exploitation efficiency during later stages of the search process may be reduced.
 Moreover,
 as problem dimensionality increases,
 maintaining fast convergence and high solution accuracy can become more difficult.
 These observations have motivated extensive research efforts toward the development of enhanced DE variants,
 aiming to improve adaptability,
 scalability,
 and the balance between exploration and exploitation in large-scale optimization problems.

 These approaches highlight the ongoing research interest in designing efficient and scalable optimization frameworks for large-scale problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work,
 a unified and modular DE framework is proposed to improve efficiency,
 robustness,
 and convergence behavior in large-scale optimization problems.
 Instead of relying on a single evolutionary strategy or fixed parameter settings,
 the proposed approach integrates multiple enhancement mechanisms within a single DE framework.
 These mechanisms are designed to be independently configurable,
 allowing the algorithm to adapt more effectively to diverse problem characteristics while preserving the fundamental structure of classical DE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A unified and modular DE framework is introduced,
 integrating multiple control mechanisms within a single optimization scheme,
 including mutation weighting,
 parent selection,
 local refinement activation,
 and termination criteria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A k-means–based population sampling strategy is incorporated to preserve population structure and improve sampling efficiency in high-dimensional search spaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Alternative mechanisms for computing the differential weight parameter are proposed,
 incorporating Number-based,
 Random,
 and Migrant strategies to enhance adaptability in large-scale optimization problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An optional tournament-based parent selection strategy is employed to improve selection pressure while maintaining population diversity and robustness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A periodic local optimization refinement using deterministic local optimizers,
 such as BFGS,
 is integrated to enhance solution accuracy and accelerate convergence without compromising global exploration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A population-based termination criterion is introduced to enable early stopping when convergence stagnation is detected,
 significantly reducing unnecessary objective function evaluations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The proposed framework is specifically designed for large-scale global optimization problems and aims to achieve a more effective balance between exploration and exploitation compared to classical DE variants.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the individual enhancement mechanisms employed in the proposed framework,
 including adaptive termination strategies,
 clustering-based population initialization,
 adaptive differential weight schemes,
 and local optimization techniques,
 have been previously studied in the literature,
 their combined integration within a single DE framework is not straightforward.
 Each mechanism operates at a distinct stage of the evolutionary process and affects different aspects of the search dynamics,
 such as diversity preservation,
 convergence behavior,
 and computational efficiency.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contribution of the present work lies in the systematic and modular coordination of these mechanisms within a unified optimization framework.
 By enabling controlled interaction between global exploration,
 adaptive parameter control,
 local exploitation,
 and termination mechanisms,
 the proposed approach facilitates synergistic effects that cannot be readily achieved through the isolated application of individual enhancements.
 This structured integration provides a principled framework for improving robustness and scalability in large-scale global optimization problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Importantly,
 the novelty of the proposed approach lies not in the introduction of new standalone operators,
 but in the principled way these mechanisms are coordinated within a single framework.
 Each component is explicitly designed to operate in synergy with the others,
 rather than being applied independently.
 In particular,
 structured sampling and adaptive differential weighting jointly influence population diversity and step-size control,
 while tournament selection ensures that informative population feedback is preserved for adaptive mechanisms to exploit.
 This coordinated interaction provides a theoretical justification for the combined framework and explains why its behavior cannot be reduced to a simple aggregation of existing techniques.

2.1 The original DE method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DE is a population-based evolutionary algorithm that has been widely used for continuous optimization problems.
 The method maintains a population of candidate solutions,
 which are iteratively evolved through the application of mutation,
 crossover,
 and selection operators.
 At each iteration,
 new candidate solutions are generated by combining information from multiple population members,
 while selection is performed based on objective function comparisons.
 The DE procedure begins by defining the population size 
\begin_inset Formula $NP$
\end_inset

.
 In order to ensure the feasibility of the classical DE mutation operator,
 which requires three distinct population members in addition to the target vector,
 a minimum population size of 
\begin_inset Formula $NP\geq4$
\end_inset

 is required.
 In practice,
 the population size is often related to the dimensionality of the optimization problem.
 A commonly adopted guideline in the DE literature is to set 
\begin_inset Formula $NP=10n$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 denotes the problem dimension,
 as this choice has been shown to provide robust performance across a wide range of problems without extensive parameter tuning.
 We note that alternative formulations relating the population size to the problem dimension have also been proposed in the literature;
 however,
 such choices are problem-dependent and do not affect the general applicability of the DE framework.
 The initial population is generated randomly within the search space and evaluated using the objective function.
 During each iteration,
 for every target vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{i}$
\end_inset

,
 three distinct population members are randomly selected to construct a mutant vector through a differential mutation operation.
 This mutant vector is then combined with the target vector using a binomial crossover mechanism,
 producing a trial vector.
 If the trial vector achieves an objective function value that is not worse than that of the target vector,
 it replaces the target vector in the population.
 The evolutionary process continues until a termination criterion is satisfied,
 such as reaching a maximum number of iterations or meeting a convergence condition.
 The algorithm returns the best solution found during the search process.
 Regarding parameter settings,
 the crossover probability is set to 
\begin_inset Formula $CR=0.9$
\end_inset

 and the differential weight to 
\begin_inset Formula $F=0.8$
\end_inset

,
 following values commonly adopted in the DE literature
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "key-2-1,key-22"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 These parameter values have been empirically shown to provide stable performance across a broad range of optimization problems without requiring problem-specific tuning.
 In this study,
 all parameters of the original DE algorithm are kept fixed throughout the experimental evaluation in order to ensure a fair and unbiased comparison with the proposed method.
 For clarity,
 the full steps of the original DE algorithm are summarized in Algorithm 1.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
2.2 The proposed DE method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main contribution of the proposed approach is the formulation of a unified and modular DE framework that systematically integrates multiple control mechanisms within a single optimization scheme.
 Unlike most existing DE variants,
 which typically modify a single algorithmic component (e.g.,
 mutation strategy or parameter adaptation),
 the proposed method allows the independent configuration and combined use of several algorithmic mechanisms while preserving the fundamental evolutionary structure of the original DE algorithm.
 The proposed method extends the classical DE framework by introducing a modular design that incorporates additional control components related to differential weight computation,
 parent selection,
 local refinement,
 and termination criteria.
 This design enables both the independent analysis of each component and their joint exploitation within a single,
 coherent optimization process,
 facilitating a systematic investigation of robustness and parameter sensitivity.
 The main methodological contributions of the proposed framework can be summarized as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Alternative mechanisms for differential weight computation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A k-means–based population sampling strategy is incorporated to preserve population structure and improve sampling efficiency in high-dimensional search spaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Optional tournament-based parent selection strategies,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Periodic local refinement using a deterministic local optimizer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A population-based termination criterion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algorithm starts with an initialization phase in which a population of 
\begin_inset Formula $NP$
\end_inset

 agents is randomly generated and evaluated using the objective function.
 Additional control parameters are also initialized at this stage,
 including the local search rate 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

,
 which determines the frequency of local refinement,
 the tournament size 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}$
\end_inset

,
 which controls selection pressure,
 the maximum number of generations 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{g}$
\end_inset

,
 the termination criteria 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{I}$
\end_inset

,
 and the iteration counter 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 During the evolutionary process,
 different strategies for computing the differential weight 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 can be employed.
 These include a constant value,
 a random mechanism defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $F=-0.5+2r$
\end_inset

,
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $r\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

,
 as well as a migrant-based strategy.
 For each agent,
 candidate solutions are generated through mutation and crossover operations,
 followed by a selection step based on objective function comparisons.
 In addition to the evolutionary operators,
 a deterministic local search procedure based on the BFGS method
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "powell"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 may be periodically applied to refine promising solutions.
 The optimization process proceeds iteratively until a termination condition is satisfied,
 which may be defined either by a maximum number of generations or by a population-based convergence criterion.
 By jointly integrating stochastic variation,
 adaptive differential weight mechanisms,
 and deterministic local refinement within a unified framework,
 the proposed method aims to improve search efficiency and to achieve a more effective balance between exploration and exploitation.
 Moreover,
 the modular structure of the algorithm allows the systematic evaluation of the effect of individual algorithmic components,
 as demonstrated in the sensitivity analysis presented in Section 3.
 For clarity,
 the complete steps of the proposed DE algorithm are summarized in Algorithm 2.

Test Functions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A variety of benchmark test functions were used in the conducted experiments.
 These functions have been widely adopted in previous studies

 In the present work,
 the test functions are evaluated using dimensionalities ranging from 25 to 150,
 where the constant n denotes the dimension of the objective function.
 The benchmark test functions used in the experimental study are summarized in Table 1,
 including their mathematical formulation,
 dimensionality,
 and global optimum values.

A series of experiments were carried out for the previously mentioned functions and these experiments were executed on an AMD RYZEN 5950X with 128GB RAM.
 The operating system of the running machine was Debian Linux.
 Each experiment was conducted 30 times,
 with different random numbers each time,
 and the averages were recorded.
 The software used in the experiments was coded in ANSI C++ using the freely available optimization environment of OPTIMUS

 The inclusion of Genetic Algorithm provides a well-established reference approach in global optimization,
 allowing a clearer assessment of the performance of the proposed method.
 All comparative methods were independently implemented and evaluated within the same experimental framework and were not directly adopted from the corresponding literature.
 All algorithms were implemented in ANSI C++ and executed under identical hardware and software conditions to ensure a fair and consistent comparison.
 All algorithms were run using the same termination criterion,
 in order to ensure a fair and reproducible comparison.
 To guarantee comparability across all methods,
 common control parameters were fixed,
 as summarized in Table 2.
 Specifically,
 the number of agents (population size) was set to 200 for all algorithms,
 the maximum number of iterations was fixed at 200,
 and the local search rate was uniformly set to 0.05.
 These shared settings ensure that performance differences arise from algorithmic design rather than differences in experimental configuration.
 Algorithm-specific parameters were selected according to standard practices reported in the literature and were kept constant throughout all experiments.
 No problem-specific parameter tuning was applied in order to avoid bias and to maintain methodological consistency.
 The parameter settings for both the proposed method and the GA are summarized in the Table

 presents the impact of the three differential weight strategies NUMBER(T),
 RANDOM(T),
 and MIGRANT(T) on the performance of the algorithm across a broad set of benchmark functions,
 where (T) denotes tournament–based selection.
 The results clearly show that MIGRANT(T) is by far the most efficient method..
 The MIGRANT(T) strategy consistently achieves the best outcomes,
 requiring the fewest objective function evaluations overall (387,335) compared with NUMBER(T) (527,444) and RANDOM(T) (543,201).
 This improvement is particularly noteworthy given that all three strategies achieve the same overall success rate (0.85),
 indicating that the performance advantage arises purely from efficiency rather than reliability differences.
 This trend is visible across multiple test functions.
 In the Attractive Sector family (25–150 dimensions),
 MIGRANT(T) demonstrates uniformly superior performance.
 For example,
 in Attractive Sector_25,
 it requires 1697 calls,
 compared with 1743 for NUMBER(T) and 1756 for RANDOM(T).
 As dimensionality increases,
 this advantage becomes even more pronounced.
 The performance gap becomes even more substantial in multimodal landscapes such as Buche–Rastrigin.
 In Buche Rastrigin_25,
 MIGRANT(T) needs 5893 function calls (success rate 0.90),
 significantly fewer than NUMBER(T) (12,243) and RANDOM(T) (12,035).
 The difference becomes overwhelming in the highest-dimensional case (Buche Rastrigin_150):
 MIGRANT(T) completes the optimization with 23,466 calls,
 while NUMBER(T) requires 40,240,
 and RANDOM(T) needs 39,263.
 These results underline MIGRANT(T)’s superior adaptability in sharply multimodal and high-variance landscapes.
 For example,
 Ellipsoidal_150 is solved in 16,930 calls by MIGRANT(T),
 compared with 19,311 for NUMBER(T) and 19,940 for RANDOM(T).
 This difference becomes particularly important for large-scale smooth problems,
 where maintaining efficiency is critical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 the evidence strongly indicates that MIGRANT(T) is the most effective differential weight mechanism among the tested variants.
 It consistently reduces the number of function evaluations across a wide variety of functions both unimodal and multimodal while preserving identical success rates.
 This combination of efficiency,
 robustness,
 and stability makes MIGRANT(T) a particularly advantageous choice for enhancing the performance of DE in high-dimensional and challenging optimization scenarios.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 2 presents a pairwise statistical comparison of the three migration strategies MIGRANT (T),
 NUMBER (T),
 and RANDOM (T)with respect to the required number of function evaluations.
 The Kruskal–Wallis test (p = 0.3) does not indicate the presence of statistically significant overall differences among the three strategies,
 suggesting comparable distributions of computational cost.
 This outcome is consistent with the results of the pairwise t-tests,
 for which none of the comparisons reach statistical significance (p > 0.05).
 Accordingly,
 the observed differences in medians and dispersion across the strategies are not supported as statistically significant.
 The MIGRANT (T) strategy exhibits a slightly lower average number of function evaluations;
 however,
 this difference is not accompanied by statistical significance and remains within the range of stochastic variability.
 Overall,
 the results indicate similar behavior of the three migration strategies in terms of computational cost.

compares the four selection strategies RANDOM(R),
 RANDOM(T),
 MIGRANT(R),
 and MIGRANT(T),
 where (R) denotes purely random selection and (T) denotes tournament–based selection.
 The results clearly show that MIGRANT(T) is by far the most efficient method.
 It achieves the lowest total number of objective function evaluations (387,335),
 significantly outperforming MIGRANT(R) (962,599),
 RANDOM(T) (543,201),
 and RANDOM(R) (767,225).
 Since all methods achieve the same success rate (0.85),
 the performance differences are due solely to efficiency,
 demonstrating the importance of the selection mechanism.
 This advantage becomes evident across nearly all tested functions.
 For the Attractive Sector family (25–150 dimensions),
 MIGRANT(T) consistently requires the fewest evaluations.
 For example,
 in Attractive Sector_25,
 it needs only 1697 calls,
 compared to 2174 MIGRANT(R),
 1756 for RANDOM(T) and as many as 2162 for RANDOM(R).
 The differences are even more striking for multimodal benchmarks such as Buche–Rastrigin.
 In the 25-dimensional case,
 MIGRANT(T) achieves 5893 calls (0.90 success),
 while MIGRANT(R) needs 15,894,
 RANDOM(T) needs 12,035,
 and RANDOM(R) 11,921.
 At the 150-dimensional level,
 the gap widens dramatically:
 MIGRANT(T) requires 23,466 calls,
 whereas MIGRANT(R) rises to 77,590,
 RANDOM(T) 39,263 and RANDOM(R) to 54,663.
 These results highlight the strong stabilizing effect that tournament selection has on the MIGRANT mechanism.
 The superiority of MIGRANT(T) is even more pronounced in the Sharp Ridge functions.
 In Sharp Ridge_150,
 MIGRANT(T) completes the optimization with 6481 calls,
 while MIGRANT(R) requires 12,053,
 RANDOM(T) 8237,
 and RANDOM(R) 12,395.
 Finally,
 in the Zakharov functions,
 MIGRANT(T) again shows consistently superior performance.
 In Zakharov_150,
 MIGRANT(T) needs just 6304 calls,
 compared to 25,370 for MIGRANT(R),
 7553 RANDOM(T) and 16,240 for RANDOM(R).
 Even in the easier 25-dimensional case,
 MIGRANT(T) requires 2185 calls,
 whereas RANDOM(R) requires over twice as many (4605).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 these results highlight the strong interaction between the MIGRANT mechanism and tournament selection.
 Tournament selection dramatically enhances the performance of MIGRANT,
 reducing the computational cost by large margins across all functions while preserving identical success rates.
 As a result,
 MIGRANT(T) emerges as the most balanced,
 stable,
 and efficient strategy,
 making it highly suitable for optimization scenarios where minimizing objective function evaluations is essential.

Figure 3 presents a pairwise statistical comparison of the four strategies MIGRANT (T),
 MIGRANT (R),
 RANDOM (T) and RANDOM (R) based on their distributions of function calls.
 The Kruskal–Wallis test indicates a statistically significant overall difference among the groups (p = 0.0019),
 suggesting that at least one strategy differs from the others in terms of computational cost.
 To further examine these differences,
 pairwise t-tests were conducted,
 with p-values annotated using standard significance notation (ns:
 p > 0.05,
 :
 p < 0.05,
 *:
 p < 0.01,
 ***:
 p < 0.001,
 ****:
 p < 0.0001) The pairwise analysis shows that MIGRANT (T) differs significantly from MIGRANT (R) and RANDOM (R),
 with the corresponding comparisons reaching higher levels of statistical significance.
 The strategies MIGRANT (R) and RANDOM (T) exhibit intermediate behavior,
 with several pairwise comparisons indicating statistically significant differences at moderate significance levels.
 Comparisons labeled as “ns” indicate pairs for which no statistically significant differences are detected.
 Overall,
 the distributions of function calls indicate lower evaluation counts for the MIGRANT-based strategies,
 particularly MIGRANT (T),
 relative to the RANDOM-based variants.
 These results describe differences in computational cost among the examined strategies under the considered experimental conditions.

 tournament selection is used to choose the samples that participate in the core operator of DE.
 Four strategies for computing the differential weight are evaluated:
 random weight with uniform sampling (Random(U)),
 random weight with k-means sampling

 (Random(K)),
 MIGRANT weight with uniform sampling (Migrant(U)),
 and MIGRANT weight with k-means sampling (Migrant(K)).
 The k-means method,

 and used extensively in later work [65,
 66],
 is employed not only to determine cluster centers but also as a structured sampling mechanism.
 Across all test functions,
 MIGRANT(K) consistently achieves the lowest total number of function calls (387,335) with a success rate of 0.85,
 outperforming all other sampling strategies.
 This advantage becomes clear when examining individual benchmarks.
 For the Attractive Sector family (dimensions 25–150),
 MIGRANT(K) systematically requires fewer evaluations than MIGRANT(U) and both Random methods.
 For example,
 in Attractive Sector_25,
 MIGRANT(K) uses only 1697 evaluations compared to 1738 for MIGRANT(U),
 while Random(K) and Random(U) require 1756 and 1792 respectively.
 This pattern holds across all dimensionalities,
 showing the benefit of structured sampling in unimodal landscapes.
 The effect becomes far more pronounced in multimodal functions such as Buche Rastrigin.
 In Buche Rastrigin_25,
 MIGRANT(K) needs 5893 function calls with a success rate of 0.90,
 in contrast to MIGRANT(U)'s 12,818 calls (0.03).
 Random(K) performs similarly to MIGRANT(K) in success rate but requires more evaluations (12,035),
 while Random(U) is by far the least efficient (28,865 calls).
 The difference becomes dramatic in higher dimensions:
 in Buche Rastrigin_150,
 MIGRANT(K) performs the task in 23,466 calls (0.27),
 whereas Random(U) escalates to 90,211,
 showing the instability of uniform sampling in complex landscapes.
 Although differences here are smaller due to the problem’s structure,
 MIGRANT(K) preserves its advantage in stability.
 The superiority of MIGRANT(K) is again evident in the Step Ellipsoidal group.
 In Step Ellipsoidal_25,
 MIGRANT(K) requires only 5104 calls,
 remarkably lower than Random(U) (6699),
 Random (K) (6026) and still better than MIGRANT(U) (5014,
 but with lower success).
 Finally,
 for the Zakharov functions,
 MIGRANT(K) again shows the best balance between evaluation cost and success rate.
 In Zakharov_25,
 MIGRANT(K) requires only 2185 evaluations,
 beating Migrant(U) (2283),
 Random(K) (2639) and Random(U) (2797).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 integrating k-means sampling into the MIGRANT strategy leads to substantial improvements in both efficiency and reliability.
 MIGRANT(K) not only requires the fewest total function evaluations but also maintains high success rates across diverse problem categories,
 making it the most effective approach for the benchmark set.
 In contrast,
 Random(U) repeatedly demonstrates the lowest efficiency,
 highlighting the advantage of structured sampling over uniform dispersion in high-dimensional optimization.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 4 presents the pairwise t-test statistical comparison of the four strategies MIGRANT (K),
 RANDOM (K),
 MIGRANT (U) and RANDOM (U) based on their distributions of function calls.
 The Kruskal–Wallis test indicates a statistically significant overall difference among the groups (p = 0.034),
 suggesting that at least one strategy differs from the others in terms of computational cost.
 To further examine these differences,
 pairwise t-tests were conducted,
 with p-values annotated using conventional significance notation (ns:
 p > 0.05,
 :
 p < 0.05,
 *:
 p < 0.01,
 ***:
 p < 0.001,
 ****:
 p < 0.0001).
 The pairwise comparisons indicate that MIGRANT (K) differs significantly from RANDOM (K) and from MIGRANT (U),
 while no statistically significant difference is observed between MIGRANT (U) and RANDOM (U).
 Comparisons labeled as “ns” suggest statistically indistinguishable behavior between the corresponding strategy pairs.
 Overall,
 the distributions of function calls show lower evaluation counts for MIGRANT (K) relative to some of the other strategies under the examined conditions.
 The U-type variants exhibit similar behavior to the RANDOM (U) baseline.
 These results describe differences in computational cost among the considered strategies,
 without implying uniform or dominant superiority across all comparisons.

 we observe the influence of periodic local optimization on the performance of the MIGRANT method,
 considering four different local search rates:
 0.005,
 0.01,
 0.03,
 and 0.05.
 Among all settings,
 the 0.005 rate achieves the lowest total number of function calls (148,027) while maintaining a high success rate of 0.85,
 thus providing the best balance between computational efficiency and optimization reliability.
 This advantage is consistently reflected across the benchmark functions.
 In the Attractive Sector functions (25–150 dimensions),
 the 0.005 rate clearly outperforms the higher-rate configurations.
 For instance,
 in Attractive Sector_25,
 it requires only 1441 calls,
 compared to 1603 for the 0.03 rate and 1697 for the 0.05 rate.
 The improvement persists as the dimensionality increases:
 Attractive Sector_150 is solved with 1536 calls at the 0.005 rate,
 while the 0.05 rate requires 1867 calls.
 The improvement becomes dramatically more pronounced in the Buche–Rastrigin family,
 where the complexity and multimodality amplify the benefit of lower local search frequency.
 For Buche Rastrigin_25,
 the 0.005 method requires 2035 function calls (0.90 success),
 whereas the 0.05 rate jumps to 5893 calls nearly triple.
 In the high-dimensional case Buche Rastrigin_150,
 the difference is even more striking:
 5900 calls at the 0.005 rate versus 23,466 for the 0.05 rate.
 A similar trend can be seen in the Discus,
 Sharp Ridge,
 and Step Ellipsoidal functions.
 In Step Ellipsoidal_50,
 the 0.005 rate achieves 2136 calls (0.50),
 far below the 0.05 rate (2300).
 For Step Ellipsoidal_150,
 the 0.005 variant uses 2914 calls (0.27),
 while the 0.05 rate needs 3143 calls.
 Even in unimodal functions like Discus,
 the 0.005 method consistently leads to lower evaluation costs e.g.,
 Discus_25 requires 1525 calls vs.
 1992 for the 0.05 rate.
 The Sharp Ridge functions highlight this behavior even more strongly.
 For Sharp Ridge_25,
 the 0.005 rate requires only 1934 calls,
 in contrast to 5104 calls for the 0.05 rate more than a 2.5× increase.
 Similar improvements appear in Sharp Ridge_150,
 where the function calls rise from 2350 at 0.005 to 6481 at 0.05.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary,
 using a lower local search rate specifically the 0.005 setting results in the most efficient optimization behavior across all tested functions.
 This variant provides the lowest objective function calls without compromising success rate,
 making it the optimal choice when both efficiency and reliability are essential in high-dimensional optimization tasks.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 5 presents pairwise statistical comparisons among the four parameter configurations (0.001,
 0.01,
 0.03,
 and 0.05) based on their distributions of function evaluations.
 The global Kruskal–Wallis test indicates a statistically significant overall difference among the groups (p = 2.9e−08),
 suggesting that the choice of parameter value is associated with differences in computational cost.
 Pairwise comparisons were conducted using independent t-tests,
 with p-values interpreted according to conventional significance notation (ns:
 p > 0.05,
 :
 p < 0.05,
 *:
 p < 0.01,
 ***:
 p < 0.001,
 ****:
 p < 0.0001).
 As shown in the figure,
 a substantial number of pairwise comparisons reach statistically significant levels,
 while a smaller subset does not exhibit statistically significant differences.
 This indicates that,
 for many comparisons,
 the examined parameter configurations are associated with distinguishable behavior in terms of the number of function calls.
 Overall,
 the results indicate that different parameter settings correspond to varying distributions of function evaluations under the considered experimental conditions.
 The observed differences suggest a systematic influence of the parameter choice on optimizer behavior,
 without implying uniform or absolute superiority of a single configuration across all comparisons.

3.7 Parameter Sensitivity Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assess the robustness of the proposed method with respect to its main control parameters,
 a sensitivity analysis was conducted focusing on the local search rate 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

,
 the population size 
\begin_inset Formula $NP$
\end_inset

,
 and the tournament size 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Each parameter was varied independently,
 while all remaining parameters were fixed to their default values.
 For each configuration,
 the algorithm was executed multiple times under identical experimental conditions,
 and the average number of function calls was recorded.

 The results indicate a gradual increase in computational cost as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{l}$
\end_inset

increases,
 which can be attributed to the more frequent activation of the local refinement procedure.
 Nevertheless,
 the observed variation is smooth,
 and no abrupt performance degradation is observed for moderate changes in the local search rate.

Figure 7 presents the effect of the population size

\end_inset

 on the number of function calls.
 As expected,
 increasing the population size leads to a higher computational cost due to the larger number of individuals evaluated at each iteration.
 However,
 the trend remains monotonic and predictable,
 indicating stable scaling behavior rather than sensitivity to a particular population size.

Figure 8 shows the sensitivity of the algorithm to the tournament size 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}$
\end_inset

 when tournament-based parent selection is employed.
 The results demonstrate that moderate values of 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}$
\end_inset

 yield comparable performance,
 while larger tournament sizes slightly reduce the number of function calls by increasing selection pressure.
 Importantly,
 the performance differences across the tested range remain limited,
 suggesting that the algorithm is not highly sensitive to the precise choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{t}$
\end_inset

 .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 the sensitivity analysis indicates that the proposed method exhibits stable behavior across a broad range of parameter values.
 Performance variations are gradual and mainly occur at extreme settings,
 suggesting that the method can be transferred to different problem instances without requiring extensive parameter tuning.
 Regarding the termination limits,
 no sensitivity analysis was performed,
 as the same termination criterion was applied uniformly to all experiments and all reference functions.

 PROPOSED) across a wide range of test functions with dimensions of 25,
 50,
 100,
 and 150.
 Each row corresponds to a test function,
 while the columns represent the methods.
 The numerical values in each cell indicate the number of objective function calls required to find the minimum,
 while the values in parentheses show the success rate of each method in each case.
 In the last row (TOTAL),
 the total sum of function calls for each method is displayed,
 along with the average success rate.
 The best methods should simultaneously exhibit a low number of function calls (efficiency) and a high success rate (reliability).
 The analysis shows that the Proposed method delivers strong and consistent performance.
 Its overall success rate (0.85) is comparable to those of GA,
 MLSHADESPA,
 SHADE_ILS,
 IPSO,
 DE and WOA (around 0.90),
 and distinctly higher than the BICCA method (0.73).
 This indicates that the Proposed method remains dependable in locating the global minimum even when faced with complex or high-dimensional search spaces.
 In terms of computational cost,
 the Proposed method requires a total of 387,335 objective function evaluations,
 which is substantially lower than most competing techniques.
 This advantage appears consistently across the majority of tested functions.
 For example,
 in the DifferentPowers function,
 the Proposed method significantly outperforms GA across all dimensionalities:
 at 25 dimensions it uses 6,478 evaluations compared to 14,495 for GA at 100 dimensions,
 16,225 versus 28,413 and at 150 dimensions,
 21,495 versus 33,569.
 Similar observations are made for the GriewankRosenbrock function,
 where the Proposed method demonstrates clear efficiency benefits:
 at 100 dimensions it requires 6,465 evaluations whereas BICCA needs 20,462,
 and at 150 dimensions the gap widens further with 7,272 evaluations compared to 30,604 for BICCA.
 These differences illustrate the method’s robustness and its ability to maintain low computational demands in highly nonlinear and difficult optimization landscapes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary,
 the findings suggest that the Proposed method offers a strong balance between reliability and computational efficiency.
 It competes effectively with and in many cases surpasses widely used optimization algorithms,
 while maintaining a consistently lower number of objective function evaluations.
 Its stability across different functions and dimensions confirms its applicability to a broad range of optimization scenarios,
 making it a promising and efficient alternative within the field of evolutionary and metaheuristic optimization.

Figure 6 illustrates the distributions of function evaluations for the PROPOSED optimizer and the baseline algorithms.
 The Kruskal–Wallis test indicates a statistically significant overall difference among the methods (p < 2.2e−16),
 suggesting that at least one optimizer differs from the others with respect to the distribution of function-call counts.
 As shown in the figure,
 the PROPOSED method is associated with lower median values and reduced dispersion in the number of function evaluations compared with the baseline algorithms.
 These differences in the distributions indicate that the PROPOSED optimizer exhibits distinct computational behavior under the examined experimental conditions.
 Overall,
 the statistical analysis and the observed distributions suggest that the PROPOSED method requires fewer function evaluations relative to the considered baselines.
 The results describe systematic differences in computational cost among the optimizers,
 without attributing the observed behavior to a single dominant factor.

In addition to the success rates,
 Tables 9 and 10 present the mean value and standard deviation of the objective function across 30 independent runs,
 in order to provide a more informative comparison between the methods,
 especially in cases where the success rates are the same or lower.

\begin_layout Subsection*
3.9 Practical problems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To further examine the practical efficiency and scalability of the proposed optimization algorithm,
 two real-world engineering design problems were investigated:
 the GasCycle
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "key-41"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and the Tandem Queueing System
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "key-42"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 These problems were selected because they differ significantly in mathematical formulation and computational complexity,
 providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating the algorithm’s performance under diverse and realistic conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each problem was tested across multiple dimensional configurations,
 ranging from 25 to 500 variables,
 in order to assess how the algorithm behaves as the search space becomes more complex.
 For every configuration,
 the execution time in seconds was recorded as the main performance indicator.
 This experimental setup enables a direct comparison of how computational efficiency changes with increasing dimensionality.

\begin_layout Standard
In the Tandem case,
 the proposed algorithm demonstrates stable and consistent behavior across all tested dimensions,
 maintaining a relatively low number of function calls.
 Its performance remains competitive with the most efficient approaches and is clearly more scalable than methods such as GENETIC,
 BICCA,
 and IPSO,
 which exhibit a rapid increase in function calls as dimensionality grows.
 The controlled growth observed for the proposed method indicates effective search dynamics and an appropriate balance between exploration and exploitation in large-scale settings.

The execution time results further confirm these observations.
 The proposed algorithm shows smooth and predictable scaling with increasing problem dimension,
 avoiding the steep runtime growth observed in more computationally demanding methods.
 Although execution time naturally increases for larger dimensions,
 the rate of increase remains moderate,
 suggesting that the internal computational cost of the proposed approach is well managed and suitable for practical large-scale applications in the Tandem scenario.

Discussion
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Discussion"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental results provide important insights into how design choices in sampling,
 parameter adaptation,
 selection pressure,
 and local refinement collectively shape the behavior of DE in large-scale optimization settings.
 Rather than acting independently,
 these components interact in ways that significantly influence both convergence efficiency and stability.
 When such interactions are structured and coordinated,
 the algorithm exhibits more reliable behavior and reduced sensitivity to stochastic effects.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A key observation concerns the role of sampling strategies.
 The use of k-means clustering to guide population sampling consistently leads to lower computational cost and reduced variance compared to uniform sampling.
 This behavior can be attributed to the preservation of population structure,
 which helps prevent redundant exploration and encourages a more balanced coverage of promising regions of the search space.
 Similar findings have been reported in previous studies on clustering-based diversity preservation and structured population management in evolutionary algorithms,
 particularly in high-dimensional settings where random sampling often becomes inefficient.
 The tighter distributions observed for configurations employing k-means indicate improved stability,
 an essential property for large-scale optimization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differential weight mechanism further reinforces this structured behavior.
 Among the examined strategies,
 the MIGRANT-based approach demonstrates consistently lower function evaluation requirements while maintaining identical success rates compared to static or random schemes.
 This suggests that exploiting feedback from the evolving population enables the algorithm to adapt its step sizes more effectively,
 leading to more economical progress through the search space.
 Such observations are in line with existing literature on adaptive parameter control in DE,
 where learning-based or feedback-driven strategies are known to outperform fixed parameter choices,
 especially as problem dimensionality increases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Selection pressure also plays a critical role in shaping the overall dynamics of the search.
 Tournament selection,
 when combined with adaptive differential weighting,
 provides a controlled bias toward high-quality solutions without excessively reducing population diversity.
 In contrast,
 random selection introduces unnecessary stochasticity that can disrupt the learning process,
 particularly when coupled with adaptive mechanisms that rely on informative population feedback.
 The results indicate that even moderate selection pressure can significantly improve the reliability of adaptive strategies by ensuring that useful information is retained and exploited across generations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The influence of local search frequency highlights the importance of moderation in hybrid metaheuristics.
 While local refinement can enhance solution quality,
 excessive application increases computational overhead and may interfere with global exploration.
 The experimental findings show that a very low local search rate achieves the best trade-off between exploitation and efficiency,
 supporting the view that local search should act as a complementary mechanism rather than a dominant driver of the optimization process.
 This observation aligns with prior work on memetic and hybrid evolutionary algorithms,
 where controlled and infrequent local search is often more effective than aggressive refinement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When considered collectively,
 these observations explain the strong and consistent performance of the proposed method relative to classical and modern optimizers.
 Rather than relying on aggressive parameter settings or complex hybridization,
 the method benefits from a balanced integration of structured exploration and adaptive exploitation.
 The comparative results indicate that the proposed approach achieves competitive or superior performance with lower variability,
 suggesting improved robustness across diverse problem landscapes.
 Importantly,
 where statistical tests do not indicate significant pairwise differences,
 the observed performance trends are interpreted as consistent empirical behavior rather than strict dominance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 the discussion highlights that the performance gains achieved by the proposed framework stem from thoughtful algorithmic structure rather than brute-force complexity.
 By guiding the search through informed sampling,
 adaptive weighting,
 and controlled selection pressure,
 the algorithm avoids both premature convergence and inefficient exploration.
 These findings reinforce a broader principle in large-scale evolutionary optimization:
 intelligent structure and feedback-driven adaptation are often more effective than increased randomness or parameter proliferation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As is common in population-based metaheuristic methods,
 no formal convergence or complexity guarantees are provided for the proposed approach.
 Instead,
 scalability and computational behavior are assessed empirically through extensive experimental evaluation.
 The inclusion of large-scale benchmark functions and real-world engineering problems,
 such as the Tandem and GasCycle scenarios,
 enables a practical assessment of convergence trends and computational cost under increasing dimensionality.
 The observed behavior in terms of function evaluations and execution time indicates controlled scalability in large-scale optimization settings.

Conclusions

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This work explored large-scale optimization through a systematically enhanced version of the DE algorithm.
 The improvements introduced in this study were designed to address two persistent challenges in high-dimensional optimization:
 efficiency and stability.
 Throughout the experimental analysis,
 several key components proved crucial to achieving these goals.
 A central contribution is the MIGRANT differential weight mechanism,
 which consistently outperformed both the classic NUMBER and RANDOM schemes.
 Across a wide variety of benchmark functions,
 MIGRANT(T) required significantly fewer objective function evaluations while maintaining identical success rates.
 This demonstrates that an adaptive weight strategy can guide the search more intelligently,
 reducing unnecessary evaluations and offering clear performance advantages in complex landscapes.
 Equally important was the impact of the sampling strategy.
 The results showed that k-means sampling (K) provides a strong structural advantage compared to uniform sampling.
 Configurations using MIGRANT(K) repeatedly achieved the lowest evaluation counts and exhibited far smaller variance.
 Pairwise statistical tests confirmed these differences,
 with several comparisons reaching high or very high levels of significance.
 This indicates that exploiting cluster information during sampling can greatly improve the quality and diversity of candidate solutions.
 The study also highlighted the role of the selection mechanism.
 Tournament selection consistently strengthened the algorithm’s performance,
 enabling MIGRANT(T) to outperform all Random-based variants.
 This confirms that introducing even a light degree of selective pressure yields more reliable search dynamics,
 while fully random selection tends to increase noise and computational cost.
 Another important outcome relates to the local search rate.
 Although local search can refine promising candidates,
 the experiments showed that applying it too frequently becomes counterproductive.
 The lowest tested rate (0.005) offered the best trade-off,
 achieving lower computational cost and greater stability.
 In contrast,
 higher rates (0.03 and 0.05) significantly increased function evaluations without improving success rates.
 This emphasizes the need for careful calibration of exploitation mechanisms in high-dimensional settings.
 Finally,
 when compared to widely used algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms,
 BICCA,
 LSHADE-SPA,
 SHADE-ILS,
 IPSO,
 WOA,
 and DE,
 the proposed method consistently delivered superior performance.
 Taken together,
 these findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured sampling,
 adaptive weighting,
 selective pressure,
 and controlled local search within DE.
 The synergy of these components results in an optimizer that is not only faster but also remarkably stable across different problem types and dimensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A promising direction for future research is to explore how the proposed framework could be integrated with other well-established metaheuristic algorithms.
 Such a hybridization could leverage the strengths of different search strategies and potentially lead to more effective optimization performance.
 In addition,
 another interesting avenue is the incorporation of learning mechanisms such as reinforcement learning or adaptive parameter-learning techniques so that the algorithm can dynamically adjust its strategies and parameters based on the characteristics of the search landscape.
 Such a self-adaptive system could further enhance the stability,
 robustness,
 and overall efficiency of the optimization process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 this study demonstrates that carefully designed modifications to DE can lead to substantial performance gains,
 and it sets the foundation for developing even more powerful and general-purpose optimization algorithms.
