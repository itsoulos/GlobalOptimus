% For posting an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use "preprints" as the journal and change "submit" to "accept". The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

\begin_layout Abstract
Global optimization is fundamental to engineering and computer science as
 it seeks to find better solutions to both simple and complex problems.
 It aims to find the most effective and efficient solution to any problem.
 In this paper we present a variation of the differential evolution algorithm
 for large-scale Global Optimization problems.
 Differential Evolution (DE) is a universal optimization algorithm that
 is applied to many practical engineering topics.
 The DE algorithm is a population-based algorithm like genetic algorithms
 and uses similar operators such as: crossover, mutation and selection.In
 this work, a series of modifications are proposed that aim to improve the
 reliability and speed of the above technique.
 The new method was tested on a series of large-scale problems and compared
 with other global optimization techniques with promising results.
 More specifically, the proposed algorithm has been evaluated by typical
 high-dimensional numerical optimization problems.
 The functions used are from the CEC-2010 competition for Large-Scale Global
 Optimization problems.
