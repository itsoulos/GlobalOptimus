\begin_layout Abstract
Constructed neural networks with the assistance of Grammatical Evolution
 have been widely used in a series of classification and data fitting problems
 appeared recently.
 Application areas of this innovative machine learning technique include
 solving differential equations, autism screening, measuring motor function
 in Parkinson's disease.
 Although this technique has given excellent results, in many cases it is
 trapped in local minimum and cannot perform satisfactorily in many problems.
 For this purpose, it is considered necessary to find techniques to avoid
 local minima and one technique is the periodic application of local minimizatio
n techniques that will undertake to adjust the parameters of the constructed
 artificial neural network, but maintaining the already existing architecture
 created by Grammatical Evolution.
 Periodic application of local minimization techniques has shown a significant
 reduction in both classification and data fitting problems found in the
 relevant literature.

 A common way to express a neural network is as a function 
\begin_inset Formula $N(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w})$
\end_inset

.
 The vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

 represents the input pattern to the neural network and the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$
\end_inset

 stands for the vector of parameters that must be computed.
 The set of parameters is calculated by minimizing the training error:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x}_{i},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\end_inset

 the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,...,M$
\end_inset

 stands for the train set.
 The values 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 denote the target outputs for patterns 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x_{i}}$
\end_inset

 .
 Recently, various methods have appeared that minimize this equation, such

tor to determine the generalization abilities of an artificial neural network.
 Networks with a few number of neurons can be trained faster and may have
 good generalization abilities, but in many cases the optimization method
 can not escape from local minima of the error function.
 Furthermore, networks with many neurons can have a significantly reduced
 training error but require a large computational time for their training
 and many times do not perform significantly when applied to data that is
 not present in the training set.
 In this direction, many researchers proposed various methods to discover
 the optimal architecture, such as usage of genetic algorithms

\begin_layout Standard
Although the neural network construction technique has been successfully
 used in a variety of applications and is able to identify the optimal structure
 of a neural network as well as find satisfactory values for the model parameter
s, it can not avoid local minima of the error function, which results in
 reduced performance in the problems to be solved.
 In this research paper, the periodic application of local optimization
 techniques is proposed in randomly selected artificial neural networks
 constructed by Grammatical Evolution.
 Local optimization does not alter the generated neural network structure
 but can more efficiently identify values of the network parameters with
 lower values of the training error.
 The current work was applied on a many classification and data fitting
 datasets, and it seems to reduce the test error obtained by the original
 neural construction technique.

 A BNF grammar is commonly defined as a set 
\begin_inset Formula $G=\left(N,T,S,P\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The following definitions are hold for any BNF grammar:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The set 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 contains the non-terminal symbols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The set 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 has the terminal symbols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $S\in N$
\end_inset

 stands for the start symbol of the grammar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The set 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 contains the production rules of the grammar.
 These rule are used to produce terminal symbols from non - terminal symbols,
 and they are in the form 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow a$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow aB,\ A,B\in N,\ a\in T$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The production algorithm starts from the symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 and through a series of steps, produces valid programs by replacing non-termina
l symbols with the right hand of the selected production rule.
 The selection of the production rules is done in two steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Read
\series default
 the the next element V from the processed chromosome.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
Select
\series default
 the next production rule using the equation: Rule = V mod 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{R}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{R}$
\end_inset

 represents the total number of production rules for the current non – terminal
 symbol.

This grammar can produce artificial neural networks in the form:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}w_{(n+2)i-(n+1)}\sigma\left(\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_{j}w_{(n+2)i-(n+1)+j}+w_{(n+2)i}\right)\label{eq:nn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the number of processing units.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)$
\end_inset

 is commonly called sigmoid function, and it has the following definition:
\series bold
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}\label{eq:sig}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The grammar of the present method can construct artificial neural networks
 with a hidden processing layer and with a variable number of computing
 units.
 This kind of architecture is sufficient to approach any problem, as according
 to Hornik's theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Hornik"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 artificial neural networks with one level of processing can approximate
 any function if a sufficient number of computing units are available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example consider a problem with 3 inputs: 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}$
\end_inset

 An example neural network that can be constructed by the Grammatical Evolution
 procedure could be the following:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N(x)=2.1\mbox{sig}\left(10.5x_{2}+9.2x_{3}+5.7\right)+3.2\mbox{sig}\left(2.2x_{1}-4.3x_{3}+6.2\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This previously artificial neural network has two processing nodes, and
 not all inputs are necessarily connected to each processing node, since
 the Grammatical Evolution process may miss some connections.

 The BFGS method as modified by Powell 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 was incorporated in the conducted experiments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example consider a dataset with 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$
\end_inset

 and the following constructed neural network:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=2\sigma\left(1.5x_{2}-2.0\right)+2.5\sigma\left(-1.2x_{1}+3.7\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where the number of nodes is 
\begin_inset Formula $H=2$
\end_inset

.
 In this case the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$
\end_inset

 has the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}=\left(2,0,1.5,-2,2.5,-1.2,0,3.7\right)$
\end_inset

.
 If the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 has the value 
\begin_inset Formula $F=2,$
\end_inset

then the bound vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{L}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{R}$
\end_inset

 are defined as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\overrightarrow{L} & = & \left(-4,0,-3,-4,-5,-2.4,0,7.4\right)\\
\overrightarrow{R} & = & \left(4,0,3,4,5,2.4,0,7.4\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Hence the minimization method could not change the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{7}$
\end_inset

 and as a consequence the architecture of the network remains intact.

( accessed on 28 September 2024 ).
 All the experiments were conducted and averages were recorded.
 In every execution, a different seed for the random generator was used.
 The average classification error as measured on the test is recorded for
 the classification datasets and the average regression error for the regression
 datasets.
 For the case of classification datasets the displayed classification error
 for a model 
\begin_inset Formula $M(x)$
\end_inset

 and the test dataset 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is calculated as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{C}\left(M(x)\right)=100\times\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\mbox{class}\left(M\left(x_{i}\right)\right)-y_{i}\right)}{N}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The test set 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $T=\left(x_{i},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,\ldots,N$
\end_inset

 For the case of regression problems the regression error 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{R}\left(M(x)\right)$
\end_inset

 is defined as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{R}\left(M(x)\right)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(M\left(x_{i}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}}{N}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The validation of the conducted experiments was performed using the ten
 - fold cross validation technique.
  The experiments were carried out on an AMD Ryzen 5950X with 128GB of RAM,
 running the Debian Linux operating system.
 The values for the parameters of the algorithms are shown in  Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:experSettings"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 In all experimental tables, the bold notation is used to mark the method
 with the lowest classification or regression error.

The original technique of constructing artificial neural networks has significan
tly lower classification or regression errors than the other two techniques
 and the proposed method managed to improve the performance of this technique
 in the majority of the datasets.
 The percentage improvement in error is even greater in regression problems.
 In some cases the improvement exceeds 50% in the test error.
 This effect is evident in the box plots for classification and regression
 errors outlined in Figures

Furthermore, the same reduction in test error is validated from the statistical
 tests performed for classification and regression problems.

Experiments with the parameter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To verify the robustness of the proposed technique as well as its sensitivity
 to parameter changes, a new experiment was carried out in which the critical
 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{I}$
\end_inset

 parameter was varied from 5 to 20.
 This parameter determines the number of generations intervening before
 the local optimization method is executed on randomly selected chromosomes.
 The results from this experiment for the classification datasets are depicted

The method appears to have similar results for each variation of the critical
 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{I}$
\end_inset

 parameter.
 In some cases the error is smaller for low values of this parameter but
 not to a great extent.
 This effect is also evident in the box plot presented for the classification
 datasets in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

As expected, the method requires more computational time than the original
 one and in fact the smaller the value of the 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{I}$
\end_inset

 parameter the more time has to be spent since more local optimizations
 have to be performed.
 Of course, this additional computing time can be significantly reduced
 by using parallel computing techniques.

\begin_layout Standard
Another important parameter for the proposed method is the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 This parameter identifies the range of changes that the local optimization
 method can cause on randomly selected chromosomes.
 In this experiment, the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 changed from 1.5 to 8.0 and the results for the classification datasets are
 depicted in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Once again, there are no significant differences in the performance of the
 proposed technique as the critical factor 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 varies.
 In the case of the classification data, however, there is a small increase
 in the classification error as this factor increases, which may be due
 to the fact that, as we move away from the solution created by the method
 of creating neural networks, the performance of the method decreases.
 Also, the box plot for the classification datasets is depicted in Figure

Experiments with the used local search optimizer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important issue of the proposed method is the selection of the local
 search optimizer, that will be applied periodically to chromosomes selected
 randomly.
 In the current work, a modified version of the BFGS method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 was chosen since it can satisfactorily handle the constraints placed on
 the network parameters for the optimization.
 However, an additional experiment was executed using different local optimizati
on techniques and the results for the classification datasets are presented
 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:experLocalClass"

 and the results for the regression datasets are shown in Table

.

\begin_layout Standard
An extension of the artificial neural network construction technique was
 presented in the present work, in which the continuous application of a
 local optimization method to chromosomes that selected randomly, was introduced.
 The application of the local optimization method is done in such a way
 as not to alter the architecture of the neural network constructed by Grammatic
al Evolution.
 The proposed modified method was applied on a series of benchmark datasets
 found in the relevant literature and, judging from the experimental results,
 it reduced significantly the test error of the original method in most
 datasets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, to establish the stability of the proposed technique, additional
 experiments were carried out in which a number of critical parameters were
 varied over a range of values.
 After the completion of these experiments, it became clear that there is
 no significant difference in the effectiveness of the proposed method,
 even if these critical parameters change significantly from execution to
 execution.
 The only case where a significant difference in the effectiveness of the
 proposed technique was found was when different local optimization techniques
 were used, where the BFGS variant appeared to achieve the best results
 in the majority of cases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nevertheless, one major drawback of the current work is the additional execution
 time required from the execution of the local search optimization techniques.
 Since the Grammatical Evolution procedure is a modified genetic algorithm,
 the generated artificial neural networks are independent of themselves,
 parallel programming techniques may be used in order to improve the speed
 of the method, such as the usage of MPI
