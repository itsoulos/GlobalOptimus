\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
A significant number of applications from many research areas can
be considered global optimization problems, such as applications in
the area of image processing, medical informatics, economic models,
etc. This paper presents a programming tool written in ANSI C++, which
researchers can use to formulate the problem to be solved and then
make use of the local and global optimization methods provided by
this tool to efficiently solve such problems. The main features of
the suggested software are: a) Coding of the objective problem in
a high level language such as ANSI C++ b) Incorporation of many global
optimization techniques to tackle the objective problem c)Parameterization
of global optimization methods using user-defined parameters d) Usage
of a GUI application to control the optimization strategy.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The location of the global minimum for a continuous and differentiable
function $f:S\rightarrow R,S\subset R^{n}$ is formulated as
\begin{equation}
x^{*}=\mbox{arg}\min_{x\in S}f(x)\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}
where the set $S$ is defined as: 
\[
S=\left[a_{1},b_{1}\right]\otimes\left[a_{2},b_{2}\right]\otimes\ldots\left[a_{n},b_{n}\right]
\]
Methods that aim to locate the global minimum finds application in
problems from the area of economics \cite{globalecon1,globalecon2},
problems that appear very often in the area of physics \cite{global_physics1,global_physics2},
chemistry \cite{global_chemistry1,global_chemistry2}, common problems
from medicine \cite{global_med1,global_med2}, job scheduling problems
\cite{global_job1,global_job2}, water resources planning \cite{global_water1,global_water2},
network security problems \cite{global_network1,global_network2},
robotics \cite{global_robot1,global_robot2} etc. Also, global optimization
methods were used on some symmetry problems \cite{go_symmetry0,go_symmetry1,go_symmetry2}
as well as on inverse problems \cite{global_nonlinear1,global_nonlinear2,global_nonlinear3}.
In the relevant literature there are a number of global optimization
techniques, such as Adaptive Random Search methods \cite{go_adaptive1,go_adaptive2},
Controlled Random Search methods \cite{go_crs1,go_crs2}, Simulated
Annealing \cite{go_sa1,go_sa2,go_sa3}, Genetic algorithms \cite{go_ga1,go_ga2},
Ant Colony Optimization \cite{go_ant1,go_ant2}, Particle Swarm Optimization
\cite{go_pso1,go_pso2} etc. 

Due to the high importance of the global optimization problem, a variety
of hybrid optimization techniques have been proposed to handle the
global optimization problem, such as methods that combine Particle
Swarm Optimization and Genetic algorithms \cite{go_pso_genetic_hybrid1,go_pso_genetic_hybrid2},
combination of genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic classifier \cite{ga_fuzzy},
incorporation of genetic algorithm and the K-Means algorithm \cite{ga_kmeans},
combination of Particle Swarm Optimization method with Ant Colony
Optimization \cite{pso_aco1,pso_aco2,pso_aco3}, methods that combine
the Simplex method and Inductive search \cite{hybrid1} etc. Also,
many hybrid techniques combining local and global optimization have
been developed \cite{go_local1,go_local2,go_local3}.

Just a few recent application examples include an adaptive genetic
algorithm for crystal structure prediction \cite{genetic_physics1},
modeling of fusion plasma physics with genetic algorithms \cite{genetic_physics2},
usage of genetic algorithms for astroparticle physics studies \cite{genetic_physics3},
parameter extraction of solar cells using a Particle Swarm Optimization
method \cite{pso_physics1}, a new control approach of a fleet of
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles using the method of Particle Swarm Optimization\cite{pso_physics2}
etc.

However, in most cases, global optimization methods require a lot
of computing resources to implement both in memory and computing time.
Because of the large demands that global optimization methods have
on computing power, several techniques have been proposed, such as
asynchronous methods \cite{async1,async2,async3}, parallel approaches
of the Multistart optimization method \cite{parallel-multistart,parallel-multistart2}
and also some methods that take advantage of modern parallel GPU architectures
\cite{gpu1,gpu2,gpu3}.

In this paper, a new integrated computing environment for performing
global optimization methods for multidimensional functions is presented
and analyzed in detail. In this computing environment, the programmer
can code the problem to be solved using a high-level programming language
such as C++. In addition to the objective function, the programmer
can also provide information that the objective problem should have
at the start of the optimization process and, in addition, can formulate
a series of actions that will take place after the optimization process
is finished. Subsequently, the researcher can formulate a strategy
to solve the problem. In this strategy, the researcher can choose
from a series of sampling methods, choose a global minimization method
established in the relevant literature and possibly some local minimization
method to improve the produced result. Similar software environments
can be found, such as the BARON software package \cite{baron} for
non-convex optimization problems, the MERLIN optimization software
\cite{merlin} which is accompanied by the Merlin Control Language
compiler to guide the optimization course, the DEoptim software \cite{deoptim}
which is an R package implementing the differential evolution algorithm,
the PDoublePop optimization software \cite{pdoublepop} that implements
a parallel genetic algorithm for global optimization etc.

Also, recently, some other optimization tools have appeared, such
as the Paradiseo \cite{paradiseo} implemented in C++, which mainly
includes evolutionary algorithms, the Pagmo software \cite{pagmo}
where a wide range of evolution algorithms are incorporated to solve
optimization problems, and finally another approach for evolutionary
algorithms applied to optimization problems is the HeuristicLab freely
available from \url{https://dev.heuristiclab.com/trac.fcgi/}, used
mainly for online optimization. In the proposed software, the user
can write the required objective function in simple C++ and then choose
from a wide range of global optimization methods, the most suitable
one for finding the global minimum. Furthermore, in the proposed software,
the user can parameterize the local minimization method to be used
as well as the termination method to be used for the successful termination
of the technique. In addition, it is possible for the user to create
his own global minimization method from scratch using the programming
tools of the Optimus libraries.

The rest of this article is structured as follows: in section \ref{sec:Software}
the proposed software is outlined in detail, in section \ref{sec:Experiments}
some experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed
software and finally, in section 4 some conclusions and guidelines
for future work are presented.

\section{Software\label{sec:Software}}

The suggested software is entirely coded in ANSI C++, using the freely
available QT programming library, which can be downloaded from \url{https://qt.io}
(accessed on 2 September 2024). The researcher should code the objective
function and a number of other mandatory functions in the C++ programming
language. Also, the researcher should provide the dimension of the
objective function as well as the bound of the function (equation
\ref{eq:eq1}). Subsequently, the user can select a global optimization
method to apply to the problem from a wide range of available methods.
Also, the user can extend the series of methods by adding any new
method that follows the guidelines of the software.\textbf{ }In the
following subsections, the installation process of the suggested software
will be analyzed and a complete example of running an objective problem
will be given.

\subsection{Installation }

The software can be installed in almost any operating system running
a C++ compiler and the freely available library of QT. The steps to
install the software are similar to most operating systems and have
as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Download and install the QT programming library from \url{https://qt.io }. 
\item Download and unzip the software from \url{https://github.com/itsoulos/GlobalOptimus}.
\item Issue the command:\emph{ cd GlobalOptimus-master }
\item Execute the command \emph{qmake} (or \emph{qmake-qt5} in some installations).
\item Execute the command \emph{make}
\end{enumerate}
The compilation will take some minutes and the final outcome of this
compilation will be the executable \emph{GlobalOptimus}.

\subsection{Windows installation}

Windows users can use the Xoptimus.msi installation package in order
to install the software in Windows environments. The steps of the
installation are shown in Figure \ref{fig:windowsInstall}. The user
should only select the desired installation directory and the installer
copies the necessary files to this directory.
