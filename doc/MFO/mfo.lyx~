\begin_layout Abstract
Global optimization is a fundamental tool for addressing complex and nonlinear problems across scientific and technological domains.
 The primary objective of this work is to enhance the efficiency,
 stability,
 and convergence speed of the Magnificent Frigatebird Optimization (MFO) algorithm by introducing new strategies that strengthen both global exploration and local exploitation.
 To this end,
 we propose an improved version of MFO that incorporates three novel movement strategies (aggressive,
 conservative,
 and mixed),
 a BFGS-based local search procedure for more accurate solution refinement,
 and a dynamic termination criterion capable of detecting stagnation and reducing unnecessary function evaluations.
 The algorithm is extensively evaluated on a diverse set of benchmark functions,
 demonstrating substantially lower computational cost and higher reliability compared to classical evolutionary and swarm-based methods.
 The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed modifications and highlight the potential of the enhanced MFO to be applied to demanding real-world optimization problems.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The primary objective of global optimization is to locate the global minimum of a continuous and multidimensional function,
 in such a way as to ensure complete exploration of the search space.
 Global optimization aims to examine the entire problem domain in order to find the lowest possible value that is feasible.
 This procedure is applied to complex functions which usually include multiple local minima,
 making it difficult to identify the global minimum.
 Global optimization includes techniques that ensure that local optima are avoided while focusing on maximizing the accuracy and efficiency of the search process.
 The objective is to find the lowest point through systematic exploration of the entire domain of the function
\begin_inset Formula $f:S\rightarrow R,S\subset R^{n}$
\end_inset

 and it is defined as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x^{*}=\mbox{arg}\min_{x\in S}f(x)\label{eq:eq1-1}

where the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is defined as follows:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S=\left[a_{1},b_{1}\right]\times\left[a_{2},b_{2}\right]\times\ldots\left[a_{n},b_{n}\right]
\]

\begin_layout Standard
Global optimization methods aim to avoid premature convergence to local minima while maintaining a balance between accurate exploitation and wide-range exploration of the search space.
 Owing to their ability to cope with highly complex energy landscapes,
 global optimization techniques have become a rapidly evolving field,
 with numerous studies addressing their theoretical foundations and practical applications

.
 During the past decade,
 bio-inspired metaheuristics have emerged as powerful alternatives to classical optimization algorithms,
 offering flexible mechanisms for balancing exploration and exploitation.
 Among these approaches,
 the Magnificent Frigatebird Optimization (MFO) algorithm is notable for its modeling of the kleptoparasitic foraging behavior of frigatebirds,
 which alternate between broad exploratory movements and targeted dives toward promising prey.
 This behavioral inspiration provides a computational framework capable of navigating difficult search landscapes through adaptive and dynamic movement patterns.
 The present work introduces an improved version of the MFO algorithm with the aim of increasing efficiency,
 accelerating convergence,
 and enhancing stability.

.
 Deterministic approaches rely on rigorous mathematical principles and provide theoretical guarantees for identifying the global minimum.
 Interval analysis techniques constitute a representative paradigm,
 progressively subdividing the search space to isolate promising regions.
 Although such methods offer reliable accuracy,
 their computational cost scales unfavorably with dimensionality,
 restricting their applicability primarily to small or medium scale problems.
 In contrast,
 stochastic global optimization methods do not guarantee convergence to the global optimum;
 however,
 they demonstrate considerable flexibility in highly nonlinear,
 multimodal,
 or noisy environments.
 Classical examples include Controlled Random Search

Although many nature-inspired optimization algorithms have been proposed in the literature,
 new methodological variations continue to be introduced,
 each aiming to refine specific aspects of the search process.
 Within this broader context,
 the present work examines an enhanced version of the MFO algorithm that integrates adaptive movement strategies,
 a BFGS-based local improvement mechanism,
 and an early-termination criterion.
 The combination of these components provides an alternative formulation of the search dynamics within the MFO framework and offers a complementary contribution to the ongoing development of bio-inspired optimization techniques.

\begin_layout Subsection
The main steps of the algorithm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Magnificent Frigatebird Optimization (MFO) algorithm is a biology-inspired metaheuristic that models the cooperative foraging behavior of magnificent frigatebirds in marine environments.
 Each computational agent represents a frigatebird that explores the search space in pursuit of high-quality food sources,
 i.e.,
 optimal solutions to the given problem.
 The algorithm begins by uniformly initializing a population within the feasible domain,
 thus ensuring adequate diversity.
 After evaluating the objective function,
 the best individual is recorded as the initial global optimum and serves as a reference throughout the search.
 At the beginning of each generation,
 the population is re-evaluated and a stochastically selected subset of individuals undergoes local refinement via the BFGS method.
 This hybridization endows the algorithm with a dual character,
 combining stochastic global exploration with efficient gradient-based exploitation in smooth regions of the landscape.
 The updated population is then rank-ordered according to fitness,
 enabling structured propagation of information from high-quality to lower-quality solutions.
 The core optimization dynamics are executed in Phase A (Movement Phase).
 During this stage,
 each individual selects a superior peer as a guide and updates his position using one of three movement strategies:
 aggressive,
 conservative,
 or mixed.
 These strategies correspond to distinct update mechanisms,
 each imposing different search characteristics.
 The aggressive strategy introduces strong stochastic perturbations and large displacements,
 promoting global exploration and allowing the algorithm to escape deceptive or highly multimodal regions.
 In contrast,
 the conservative strategy generates small,
 directed steps toward promising solutions,
 thereby enhancing local exploitation and enabling fine-grained refinement.
 The mixed strategy probabilistically alternates between the two modes,
 providing an adaptive mechanism that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation based on the landscape structure.
 In all strategies,
 a newly generated position is accepted only if it improves upon the current solution.
 Phase B (Dive Phase) introduces an additional exploitation-oriented update,
 wherein each agent performs a movement biased toward the current global best.
 This mechanism reinforces the intensification process and accelerates convergence once the population has entered a promising basin.
 The interplay between Phases A and B yields a search dynamic capable of performing broad exploration in the early generations and highly targeted exploitation in the later stages.
 At the end of each generation,
 the global best solution is updated,
 and whenever the activation criteria are satisfied,
 an additional BFGS refinement is applied to increase accuracy.
 A dynamic termination criterion monitors the improvement rate of the global optimum over a predefined number of generations.
 If the progress falls below a threshold or the maximum number of generations is reached,
 the algorithm terminates and returns the best solution.

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 MFO forms an adaptive optimization framework in which the aggressive and mixed strategies sustain adequate exploration,
 while the conservative updates,
 Dive Phase,
 and selectively applied BFGS refinement reinforce exploitation and ensure precise final convergence.
 The synergy among these mechanisms renders the enhanced MFO particularly effective in complex landscapes characterized by ruggedness,
 high multimodality,
 and strong nonlinearity.
 The steps of the Magnificent Frigatebird Optimization (MFO) algorithm are presented in the following Algorithm.

\begin_layout Subsection
Movement Strategies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed optimization algorithm employs three distinct movement strategies that regulate the behavioral dynamics of seabirds during the search for optimal solutions.
 Each strategy defines a different balance between exploration of the search space and exploitation of promising regions already identified.
 The aggressive strategy is characterized by strong stochastic dynamics and a tendency toward rapid discovery of new,
 potentially better regions in the search space.
 Individuals are driven toward other,
 more successful members of the population,
 performing large displacements that enhance diversity and dispersion.
 This approach promotes exploration and enables the algorithm to escape local optima.
 However,
 it also increases the risk of generating infeasible or inefficient solutions if appropriate boundary control mechanisms are not applied.
 The conservative strategy focuses on exploitation of the best-known solution,
 promoting smoother and more stable movements.
 Individuals move gradually toward the current global best position with limited randomness,
 aiming to refine the accuracy of their position over time.
 This strategy reduces population diversity and enhances convergence.
 The mixed strategy acts as an adaptive balance mechanism between the two aforementioned approaches.
 At each iteration,
 the algorithm randomly decides whether to apply the aggressive or conservative movement pattern,
 allowing dynamic transitions between exploration and exploitation phases.
 This flexibility enables the search process to adjust to the evolving characteristics of the optimization landscape,
 preventing premature convergence and maintaining adaptive search capability.
 The integration of these three strategies ensures that the algorithm maintains both exploratory power,
 essential for discovering new regions,
 and exploitative stability,
 crucial for fine-tuning solutions.
 In conclusion,
 their combined action enhances the robustness and efficiency of the method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Algorithmic architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The strength of the proposed method does not lie in any single operator but in the way its components work together within a coherent and adaptive optimization framework.
 The three movement strategies,
 the Dive Phase,
 the selectively applied BFGS refinement,
 and the dynamic termination rule are not used as isolated mechanisms,
 instead,
 each one contributes a specific functional role that the algorithm coordinates through a structured mode-switching process.
 The aggressive strategy promotes broad stochastic exploration and enables escape from deceptive or highly multimodal regions,
 while the conservative strategy emphasizes stable,
 directed exploitation toward high-quality areas of the landscape.
 The mixed strategy provides an adaptive transition between these two behaviors,
 allowing the search dynamics to adjust to the evolving geometry and difficulty of the problem.
 The Dive Phase reinforces intensification within promising basins,
 and the BFGS refinement increases precision when convergence is approaching.
 The dynamic termination rule further regulates computational effort by responding to the actual rate of progress.
 The synergy among these elements forms an adaptive architecture capable of shifting naturally from global exploration to precise local refinement.
 This coordinated interaction rather than any individual mechanism constitutes the principal innovation of the method and explains its robustness,
 reduced number of function evaluations,
 and improved convergence behavior across diverse optimization landscapes.

\begin_layout Standard
A series of experiments was carried out for the previously mentioned functions and these experiments were executed on an AMD RYZEN 5950X with 128GB RAM.
 The operating system of the running machine was Debian Linux.
 Each experiment was conducted 30 times,
 with different random numbers each time,
 and the averages were recorded.
 The software used in the experiments was coded in ANSI C++ using the freely available optimization environment of OPTIMUS

In the following tables that depict the experimental results,
 the numbers in cells stand for the average function calls,
 as measured on 30 independent runs.
 The numbers in parentheses denote the fraction of the executions where the method discovered successfully the global minimum.
 If this number is not present,
 then the method managed to locate the global minimum in every run ( 100% success).

) is based on a diverse set of benchmark functions.
 The evaluation focused on two key performance indicators:
 the total number of objective function evaluations and the corresponding success rates,
 as shown in Table 2.
 The analysis of the total function evaluations reveals substantial differences among the tested algorithms.
 The GENETIC algorithm required 316,189 evaluations,
 while WOA recorded the highest computational cost with 923,113 evaluations.
 The MEWOA,
 DE,
 IPSO,
 AOA,
 SAO,
 ACO and MYIGWO methods required 489,691,
 326,083,
 314,060,
 540,139,
 305,505,
 260,753 and 39,018 evaluations,
 respectively.
 In contrast,
 the PROPOSED algorithm achieved the lowest total number of function evaluations among the tested methods,
 requiring only 204,488 calls overall,
 demonstrating exceptional computational efficiency.
 This advantage was observed across almost all benchmark functions.
 For example,
 on the Ackley function the PROPOSED method converged in only 4,971 evaluations,
 whereas GENETIC and WOA required 5,811 and 24,766 evaluations,
 respectively.
 Similarly,
 for the Branin function,
 the PROPOSED algorithm reached convergence in 2,397 evaluations,
 compared with 2,648 for GENETIC and 4,777 for AOA.
 While the MYIGWO method required even fewer evaluations on average (approximately 39,018 in total),
 its success rate was substantially lower (around 69%),
 indicating reduced reliability in consistently reaching the optimal solution.
 This highlights a trade-off between computational speed and robustness,
 with the PROPOSED algorithm achieving both low computational cost and high consistency.
 In addition to the reduced number of evaluations,
 the PROPOSED algorithm maintained a 100% success rate on most benchmark functions,
 further supporting its reliability.
 Other methods such as DE,
 IPSO,
 and SAO also produced satisfactory results but with noticeably higher computational effort.
 By comparison,
 ACO exhibited lower consistency,
 with success rates below unity (e.g.,
 0.57 for BF1 and 0.70 for BF2).
 Overall,
 the results indicate that the PROPOSED algorithm combines strong reliability with high computational efficiency,
 achieving performance comparable to or better than well-known alternatives while requiring substantially fewer evaluations.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 2 presents the pairwise statistical significance between the PROPOSED optimizer and all baseline algorithms.
 All pairwise comparisons were conducted using the paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
 and the resulting p-values were corrected using the Holm adjustment to account for multiple testing.
 Following the conventional star notation (ns:
 p > 0.05,
 *:
 p < 0.05,
 **:
 p < 0.01,
 ***:
 p < 0.001,
 ****:
 p < 0.0001),
 all comparisons except ACO reach ****,
 indicating very-extremely significant differences.
 Specifically,
 PROPOSED differs from GENETIC,
 WOA,
 MEWOA,
 DE,
 IPSO,
 AOA,
 MYIGWO and SAO at p < 0.0001,
 whereas the comparison with ACO is not statistically significant (p > 0.05).
 In conjunction with the reported performance metrics,
 these results indicate that the advantage of PROPOSED over most baselines is highly unlikely to be due to random variation.

\begin_layout Subsection
Runtime comparison of the proposed method with others 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the table of execution times across all benchmark functions and algorithms,
 we observe that the proposed algorithm consistently maintains low values and completes most tests with a relatively small computational cost.
 For the simpler functions,
 its times remain very low,
 and even for the more demanding cases,
 its performance stays competitive.
 This suggests that the method reaches solutions without requiring an excessive number of evaluations.
 Compared with the other techniques in the table,
 the proposed algorithm generally shows lower execution times than most methods.
 Many of the remaining algorithms exhibit higher values,
 especially in more complex functions,
 indicating a greater computational load.
 Overall,
 the results show that the proposed algorithm performs well in terms of execution time and achieves a balance between speed and effectiveness.
 This stable performance makes it a reliable option among the methods that were examined.

\begin_layout Subsection
Comparative analysis of different strategic variations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To further evaluate the internal adaptability of the proposed optimization framework,
 three distinct strategic configurations:
 Aggressive,
 Conservative,
 and Mixed were examined across a comprehensive set of benchmark functions.
 The total number of objective function evaluations recorded for each configuration was 204,488 for the aggressive strategy,
 212,680 for the conservative strategy,
 and 209,767 for the mixed strategy.
 Among these,
 the aggressive configuration demonstrated the lowest computational demand,
 indicating faster convergence behavior.
 For example,
 the aggressive strategy in the Easom benchmark function required 2033 evaluations and Potential5 required 4944 evaluations.
 While in the conservative strategy Easom required 2178 evaluations and Potential5 required 5,108 evaluations.
 On the other hand,
 in the mixed strategy it required 2100 and 4914 evaluations in the corresponding functions.
 In terms of reliability,
 all three configurations demonstrated excellent success rates,
 maintaining near-perfect consistency across most benchmark functions.
 Specifically,
 the success rates were 95% for the aggressive strategy,
 93% for the conservative strategy,
 and 94% for the mixed configuration.
 The algorithm’s stable performance highlights its robustness,
 as it stays reliable under different search strategies.
 Minor differences mainly affect speed and computational effort.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 the results show that the proposed framework is flexible and adaptable,
 allowing its settings to adjust to different problems.
 The Conservative version offers a good balance between accuracy and speed,
 the Aggressive one works best on complex problems by avoiding early convergence,
 and the Mixed approach provides a stable middle ground.
 This adaptability makes the framework suitable for many optimization tasks.

Figure 3 presents the pairwise statistical comparisons between the three exploration–exploitation control modes of the proposed optimizer.
 As in the previous analysis,
 all comparisons were performed using the paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test,
 with Holm-adjusted p-values to account for multiple testing.
 Following the conventional star notation.
 AGGRESSIVE vs CONSERVATIVE reaches **** (p < 0.0001),
 indicating a very-extremely significant difference.
 CONSERVATIVE vs MIXED is ** (p < 0.01),
 showing a highly significant separation.
 MIXED vs AGGRESSIVE is *** (p < 0.001),
 reflecting an extremely significant but comparatively smaller gap.
 Overall,
 the regimes induce materially different behaviors,
 with MIXED lying closer to AGGRESSIVE than to CONSERVATIVE.

\begin_layout Subsection
Impact of Population Size on Algorithmic Performance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assess the influence of population size on convergence behavior and computational efficiency,
 both the proposed optimization algorithm and the Genetic Algorithm (GA) were evaluated under four different population configurations:
 50,
 100,
 200,
 and 500.
 The experiments were conducted using a representative suite of benchmark functions.
 In a population size of 50 individuals,
 both algorithms demonstrated rapid convergence with low computational cost.
 The proposed algorithm required only 1983 evaluations for the Ackley function,
 while BF1 required 1075 and BF2 required 983.
 The Genetic Algorithm converged after 2148 evaluations for Ackley,
 while 1258 for BF1 and 1105 for BF2.
 Despite their computational efficiency,
 both methods showed a slight decline in success rate in certain benchmark functions due to the limited population diversity.
 For example,
 the proposed algorithm achieved success rates around 0.90 for BF2 and BF3,
 while the GA achieved 97% for Ackley and 30% for Griewank2.
 When the population size was increased to 100,
 both algorithms reached their most balanced performance.
 The proposed algorithm achieved a 100% success rate on almost all test functions with 3053 evaluations for Ackley,
 1862 for BF1,
 1734 evaluations for BF2 and 1211 for Branin.
 The Genetic Algorithm achieved comparable results,
 also maintaining a 100% success rate,
 with 3331 evaluations for Ackley,
 2287 for BF1,
 and 1353 for Branin.
 This configuration provided sufficient population diversity for effective exploration without incurring significant computational overhead.
 As a result,
 a medium-sized population offered the optimal trade-off between exploration and exploitation,
 ensuring both robustness and computational efficiency.
 Further increasing the population to 200 led to a significant increase in computational cost for both algorithms.
 The proposed algorithm required 4971 evaluations for Ackley while 3449 evaluations for BF1 and 3255 for BF2.
 The GA reached 5811 evaluations for Ackley and 3494 for BF3.
 Although the success rate slightly improved,
 the additional computational effort did not yield proportional benefits in optimization performance.
 When the population size was further increased to 500,
 this pattern became even more apparent.
 The proposed algorithm required up to 10,690 evaluations for Ackley while 8346 for the BF1 function and 7825 for the BF2 function.
 The GA needed 13,664 evaluations for Ackley,
 10,866 for BF1,
 and 6716 for Branin.
 While both algorithms maintained high success rates,
 the computational effort increased drastically,
 indicating a prolonged and redundant exploratory phase that hindered convergence speed and overall efficiency.
 The comparative analysis reveals a consistent trend for both algorithms:
 population size has a direct and significant impact on convergence dynamics and computational efficiency.
 Small populations favor faster convergence but risk premature stagnation due to limited diversity.
 Very large populations improve reliability but impose excessive computational cost.
 Medium-sized populations achieve the best balance between speed,
 accuracy,
 and robustness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 the proposed algorithm consistently outperformed the Genetic Algorithm at all population levels,
 requiring fewer evaluations to reach convergence while maintaining equal or higher success rates.
 This improvement is attributed to its adaptive parameter control and dynamic balance between local and global search,
 which enhance convergence efficiency without compromising precision.
 In summary,
 population size plays a crucial role in determining the optimization efficiency of both algorithms.
 For practical applications,
 a moderate population configuration ensures optimal performance,
 achieving rapid,
 accurate,
 and stable convergence with minimal computational overhead.

Convergence Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The convergence analysis of the MFO algorithm on the Ackley and Katsuura functions shows how differently the method behaves across two distinct optimization landscapes.
 For the Ackley function,
 the algorithm starts with a G_best of 2.650 in the first generation.
 From the second generation onward,
 the value drops straight to zero and stays there.
 This means MFO quickly finds an excellent solution and remains stable without any fluctuations afterward,
 showing fast convergence and consistent performance.

Friedman Test 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results of the Friedman test clearly show that there are significant differences between the optimization algorithms we compared.
 The p-value was tiny,
 which means that these differences are not due to chance but reflect real performance variations.
 The post-hoc analysis helped identify which pairs of algorithms differ significantly.
 In most cases,
 the differences were statistically significant,
 while only a few algorithm pairs showed no meaningful difference.
 Overall,
 the proposed algorithm performed better than the others and consistently achieved the strongest results.
 Based on these findings,
 the statistical analysis confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method and shows that it consistently outperforms several well-known optimization techniques.

 in order to assess how the algorithm behaves as the search space becomes more complex.
 For every configuration,
 the execution time in seconds was recorded as the main performance indicator.
 This experimental setup enables a direct comparison of how computational efficiency changes with increasing dimensionality.

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental analysis conducted in this study offers a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed optimization framework across a wide range of benchmark functions and parameter configurations.
 The results provide clear evidence of the algorithm’s strong convergence behavior,
 computational efficiency,
 and robustness when compared with several state-of-the-art metaheuristics.
 The performance was assessed on both unimodal and multimodal landscapes,
 ensuring that the conclusions drawn reflect diverse and challenging optimization scenarios.
 Across all benchmark functions,
 the proposed method demonstrated consistently stable and competitive convergence dynamics.
 In comparison with well-established algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm,
 WOA,
 MEWOA,
 Differential Evolution,
 iPSO,
 AOA,
 SAO,
 and ACO,
 the proposed variant achieved the lowest number of function evaluations in nearly every test case,
 while maintaining a 100% success rate in most functions.
 These findings underscore the algorithm’s capacity to reach high-quality solutions efficiently and reliably,
 reflecting its well-balanced interplay between global exploration and local exploitation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The statistical analysis further reinforces these conclusions.
 Pairwise hypothesis testing revealed that the differences between the proposed method and nearly all baseline algorithms were highly significant,
 with the majority of comparisons yielding p-values below 0.0001.
 This confirms that the performance improvements observed are not attributable to stochastic variability.
 Additionally,
 comparisons among the three exploration–exploitation control modes revealed statistically significant behavioral differences,
 validating the distinct roles and contributions of each strategy within the overall search dynamic.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A deeper examination of the internal movement strategies 
\series bold
Aggressive,
 Conservative,
 and Mixed 
\series default
provides insight into the adaptability of the proposed framework.
 The Conservative mode offered an efficient compromise between computational effort and solution precision,
 while the Aggressive mode performed particularly well in highly multimodal landscapes by enabling rapid escape from deceptive regions.
 The Mixed strategy,
 which probabilistically alternates between aggressive and conservative updates,
 produced consistently reliable results across a wide variety of problems.
 These observations highlight the algorithm’s ability to adjust its search behavior according to landscape characteristics.
 The effectiveness of each strategy is closely linked to the way it interacts with the underlying fitness landscape.
 The Aggressive strategy benefits problems with many local minima by promoting large stochastic jumps and reducing stagnation,
 whereas the Conservative strategy is more suitable for unimodal or smoothly varying functions,
 where smaller directed updates accelerate convergence.
 The Mixed strategy is advantageous in complex or hybrid landscapes,
 where a dynamic balance between exploration and exploitation is essential.
 Overall,
 the reduction in function evaluations arises from the synergy among these strategies:
 aggressive exploration enables rapid identification of promising regions,
 conservative refinement improves them efficiently,
 and the mixed behavior prevents premature convergence.
 As a result,
 computational effort is concentrated where it is most impactful,
 enhancing the overall convergence speed.
 The differences among the three strategies become more evident when examining the mathematical update rules that govern their behavior.
 The 
\series bold
Aggressive strategy 
\series default
is defined by:
 
\begin_inset Formula $[y_{j}=P_{i,j}+2(r-0.5)\left(SS_{j}-IP_{i,j}\right),]$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $(r\in[0,1])$
\end_inset

.
 The scaling term 
\begin_inset Formula $2(r-0.5)$
\end_inset

 allows large bidirectional steps along the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $((SS_{j}-IP_{i,j}))$
\end_inset

,
 thereby enhancing global exploration and facilitating escape from deceptive or narrow local minima.
 The 
\series bold
Conservative strategy
\series default
 uses the update:
\begin_inset Formula $[y_{j}=P_{i,j}+0.3(r-0.5)\left(x_{best,j}-P_{i,j}\right),]$
\end_inset

 where the reduced coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3(r-0.5)$
\end_inset

constrains the movement to small,
 stable steps directed toward the current best solution.
 This promotes exploitation and ensures efficient local refinement in relatively smooth or unimodal landscapes.
 The Mixed strategy alternates between the aggressive and conservative updates with equal probability,
 effectively combining large exploratory jumps with fine-grained exploitation.
 This probabilistic mechanism prevents stagnation while maintaining convergence pressure when promising regions are detected.
 Together,
 these updated equations explain the behavioral distinctions of the three strategies:
 the aggressive formulation increases variance and encourages broader exploration,
 the conservative one focuses the search around high-quality regions,
 and the mixed approach dynamically balances both tendencies.
 This mathematical perspective clarifies how the structure of each movement rule contributes to the overall adaptability and robustness of the proposed algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An additional avenue for future research involves introducing stochastic selection of movement strategies either on a per-individual or per-iteration basis.
 Random assignment of Aggressive,
 Conservative,
 or Mixed behavior across individuals may increase behavioral diversity and strengthen global exploration,
 whereas stochastic switching at each iteration could create a time-varying exploration–exploitation balance.
 Although such mechanisms were not explored in the present study,
 they represent promising directions for enhancing adaptability and reducing stagnation in highly deceptive or heterogeneous landscapes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impact of population size was also investigated for both the proposed method and the standard Genetic Algorithm.
 In both cases,
 population size played a critical role in shaping convergence speed and computational cost.
 Smaller populations converged rapidly but occasionally suffered from reduced diversity,
 while excessively large populations introduced redundant evaluations.
 Optimal performance was observed for medium-sized populations,
 where a well-balanced exploration–exploitation trade-off was maintained.
 When directly compared under identical conditions,
 the proposed algorithm consistently outperformed the Genetic Algorithm,
 requiring fewer evaluations to achieve convergence without sacrificing success rate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary,
 the experimental results confirm that the proposed optimization framework achieves an effective balance between computational efficiency,
 convergence accuracy,
 and robustness.
 It adapts well to diverse problem structures and parameter settings,
 consistently outperforming classical evolutionary and swarm-based approaches.
 Its combination of fast convergence,
 stable behavior,
 and high reliability underscores its potential as a powerful,
 scalable,
 and versatile tool for real-world optimization applications.

\begin_layout Standard
This study introduced a novel optimization framework that integrates an adaptive mechanism to maintain an effective balance between exploration and exploitation throughout the search process.
 The experimental evaluation,
 conducted across a comprehensive suite of benchmark functions,
 demonstrated that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms several well-established metaheuristics in terms of convergence accuracy,
 computational speed,
 and overall efficiency.
 Furthermore,
 statistical analyses confirmed that these improvements are statistically significant and not attributable to random variability.
 The investigation of the internal search strategies Aggressive,
 Conservative,
 and Mixed also revealed the algorithm’s capacity to adjust its search dynamics in accordance with the structural characteristics and difficulty of the optimization problem.
 This adaptability promotes a well-calibrated interaction between global exploration and local exploitation,
 ultimately contributing to stable and efficient convergence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite its strong empirical performance,
 the enhanced MFO variant presents certain limitations that merit consideration.
 As a population-based stochastic optimizer may incur substantial computational cost in high-dimensional or noisy scenarios,
 where maintaining population diversity becomes increasingly challenging and the integrated local search component adds to the per-iteration overhead.
 Moreover,
 the three movement strategies exhibit landscape-dependent behavior:
 aggressive steps may overshoot narrow basins of attraction,
 whereas conservative steps may lead to premature convergence in highly multimodal terrains.
 These observations highlight several promising research directions,
 including adaptive regime selection,
 dimensionality-reduction mechanisms,
 surrogate-assisted extensions,
 and more rigorous theoretical convergence studies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A promising direction for future research is to explore how the proposed framework could be combined with other well-established metaheuristic algorithms,
 such as Differential Evolution or Particle Swarm Optimization.
 Such hybridization could leverage the strengths of different search strategies and potentially lead to more effective optimization performance.
 In addition,
 applying the improved MFO to large-scale and high-dimensional optimization problems would provide a more complete assessment of its scalability,
 robustness,
 and practical usefulness in real-world scenarios where computational demands are considerably higher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 the proposed algorithm constitutes a flexible and powerful optimization approach capable of addressing both simple and complex real-world problems.
 Its consistently superior performance,
 supported by statistical validation,
 underscores its potential for applications requiring high precision,
 adaptability,
 and computational efficiency.
