\begin_layout Abstract
A machine learning technology that has been used in a wide range of everyday
 problems is the recently proposed technique of constructing artificial
 neural networks with the assistance of Grammatical Evolution.
 This technique was utilized in problems from the fields of physics, chemistry,
 medicine, etc., in which it had excellent performance compared to other
 machine learning models.
 A key feature of these machine learning models is that they can both construct
 the structure of an artificial neural network efficiently and identify
 optimal values of the parameters of this network at the same time.
 However, in many cases the optimization process can become trapped in local
 minima of the error function, resulting in the construction of the artificial
 neural network not being able to be completed satisfactorily, which will
 lead to poor results in terms of test error.
 In this work, the combination of the artificial neural network construction
 method with an adapted genetic algorithm is proposed, which preserves the
 structure of the neural network that has been constructed and, in addition,
 appropriately adapts the parameters of the artificial neural network in
 order to avoid overfitting problems.
 The proposed method was applied on a wide series of datasets from real
 world problems that include classification and regression problems and
 it was compared against traditional machine learning models and the results
 are reported.

.
 Artificial neural networks are parametric machine learning model, in which
 learning is achieved by effectively adjusting their parameters through
 any optimization technique.
 The optimization procedure minimizes the so - called training error of
 an artificial neural network and it is defined as: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x}_{i},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this equation the function 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)$
\end_inset

 represents the artificial neural network which is applied on a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}$
\end_inset

 and the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$
\end_inset

 denotes the parameter vector of the neural network.
 The set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,...,M$
\end_inset

 represents the training set of the objective problem and the values 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the expected outputs for each pattern 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x_{i}}$
\end_inset

.

Artificial neural networks have been applied in a wide series of problems

 Due to the widespread use of these machine learning models, a number of
 techniques have been proposed to minimize the equation

 Also, recently a series of more advanced global optimization methods have
 been proposed to tackle the training of neural networks.
 Among them one can locate the incorporation of Genetic Algorithms

 Also, recently Zhao et al introduced a new Cascaded Forward Algorithm to
 train artificial neural networks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, due to the rapid spread of the use of parallel computing technique
s, a series of computational techniques have emerged that exploit parallel
 computing structures for faster training of artificial neural networks

However, the above techniques, although extremely effective, nevertheless
 have a number of problems such as, for example, trapping in local minima
 of the error function or the phenomenon of overifitting, where the artificial
 neural network exhibits reduced performance when applied to data that was
 not present during the training process.
 The overfitting problem has been studied by many researchers that have
 proposed a series of methods to handle this problem, such as weight sharing

 Also, many researchers propose as a solution to the above problem the dynamic
 creation of the architecture of artificial neural networks using programming
 techniques.
 For example the Genetic Algorithms were proposed to create dynamically
 the optimal architecture of neural networks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This method has been applied in a series of problems in the recent literature,
 such as problems presented in chemistry

 etc.
 A key advantage of this technique is that it can isolate from the initial
 features of the problem those that are most important in training the model,
 thus significantly reducing the required number of parameters that need
 to be identified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the method of constructing artificial neural networks can easily
 get trapped in local minima of the training error since it does not have
 any technique to avoid them.
 Furthermore, although the method can get quite close to a minimum of the
 training error, it often does not reach it since there is no technique
 in the method to train the generated parameters.
 In this technique, it is proposed to enhance the original method of constructin
g artificial neural networks by periodically applying a modified genetic
 algorithm to randomly selected chromosomes of Grammatical Evolution.
 This modified genetic algorithm preserves the architecture created by the
 Grammatical Evolution method and effectively locates the parameters of
 the artificial neural network by reducing the training error.
 In addition, the proposed genetic algorithm through appropriate penalty
 factors imposed on the fitness function prevents the artificial neural
 network from overfitting.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)}\sigma\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{j}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)+j}+w_{(d+2)i}\right)\label{eq:nn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The term 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 stands for the number of processing units (weights) of the neural network.

The total number of parameters for this network are computed through the

The used genetic algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:The-used-genetic"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the original method of constructing artificial neural networks, it is
 proposed in this work to introduce the concept of local search, through
 the periodic application of a genetic algorithm which should maintain the
 structure of the neural network constructed by the original method.
 Additionally, a second goal of this genetic algorithm should be to avoid
 the problem of overfitting that could arise from simply applying a local
 optimization method to the previous artificial neural network.
 For the first goal of the modified genetic algorithm consider the example
 neural network shown before:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N(x)=1.9\mbox{sig}\left(10.5x_{1}+3.2x_{3}+1.4\right)+2.1\mbox{sig}\left(2.2x_{2}-3.3x_{3}+3.2\right)
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The weight vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$
\end_inset

 for this neural network would be 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\overrightarrow{w}=\left[1.9,10.5,0.0,3.2,1.4,2.1,0.0,2.2,-3.3,3.2\right]\label{eq:exampleNN}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In order to protect the structure of this artificial neural network, the
 modified genetic algorithm should allow changes in the parameters of this
 network within a value interval, which can be considered to be the pair
 of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\overrightarrow{L,}\overrightarrow{R}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 The elements for the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{L}$
\end_inset

 are defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
L_{i}=-F\times\left|w_{i}\right|,\ i=1,\ldots,n\label{eq:createL}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is positive number with 
\begin_inset Formula $F>1$
\end_inset

.
 Likewise the right bound for the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{R}$
\end_inset

 is defined from the following equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
R_{i}=F\times\left|w_{i}\right|,i=1,\ldots,n\label{eq:createR}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For the example weight vector of equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:exampleNN"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 and for 
\begin_inset Formula $F=2$
\end_inset

 the following vectors are used:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
L & = & \left[-3.8,-21.0,0.0,-6.4,-2.8,-4.2,0.0,-4.4,-6.6,-6.4\right]\\
R & = & \left[\ \ \ 3.8,\ \ \ 21.0,0.0,\ \ \ 6.4,\ \ \ \ 2.8,\ \ \ \ 4.2,0.0,\ \ \ 4.4,\ \ \ 6.6,\ \ \ \ 6.4\right]
\end{array}
\]

\end_inset

The modified genetic algorithm should also prevent the artificial neural
 networks it trains from the phenomenon of overfitting, which would lead
 to poor results on the test dataset.
 For this reason a quantity derived from the publication of Anastasopoulos
 et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nnt_bound"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 is utilized here.
 The sigmoid function, that is used as the activation function of neural
 networks is defined as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

A plot for this function is shown in Figure

As is clear from the equation and the figure, as the value of the parameter
 x increases, the function tends very quickly to 1.
 On the other hand, the function will take values very close to 0 as the
 parameter x decreases.
 This means that the function very quickly loses the generalizing abilities
 it has and therefore large changes in the value of the parameter x will
 not cause proportional variations in the value of the sigmoid function.
 Therefore, the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right),a\right)$
\end_inset

 was introduced in that paper to measure this effect.

( accessed on 23 January 2025 ).
 Every experiments was conducted 30 times and each time different seed for
 the random generator was used.
 The experiments were validated using the ten - fold cross validation technique.
 The average classification error, as measured in the corresponding test
 set was reported for the classification datasets.
 This error is calculated through the following formula:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{C}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=100\times\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\mbox{class}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)-y_{i}\right)}{N}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here the test set 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is a set 
\begin_inset Formula $T=\left(x_{i},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,\ldots,N$
\end_inset

.
 Likewise, the average regression error is reported for the regression datasets.
 This error can be obtained using the following equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{R}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}}{N}
\end{equation}

, the performance of different machine learning algorithms on various classifica
tion datasets is shown, as measured by error rates.
 Each column represents a specific machine learning model, while each row
 corresponds to a dataset and the error rate associated with each algorithm
 for that particular dataset.
 The last row of the table presents the average error rates for each algorithm,
 providing an overall view of their performance.
 The analysis begins with the observation that the "PROPOSED" model demonstrates
 the lowest average error rate (21.18%) compared to all other models.
 This indicates that, overall, it delivers the best performance, producing
 the most accurate results across this set of data.
 In many datasets, such as APPENDICITIS, BALANCE, and ZOO, the "PROPOSED"
 model achieves the lowest error rates, specifically 14.30%, 7.84%, and 6.60%,
 respectively, showcasing its strong performance in these cases.
 However, it is not consistently the best, as in some datasets, like MAMMOGRAPHI
C and CIRCULAR, other models exhibit slightly lower error rates.The "GENETIC"
 model records the highest average error rate, at 28.25%, which suggests
 its overall performance is the weakest across this dataset collection.
 However, it is noted that in certain datasets, such as CIRCULAR and HOUSEVOTES,
 the "GENETIC" model performs relatively well with error rates of 5.99% and
 6.62%, respectively, which are comparable to those of the more effective
 models.
 This indicates that its performance may depend on the specific characteristics
 of each dataset.
 Another noteworthy algorithm is "BFGS," which has an average error rate
 of 35.71%.
 While its performance is not consistently strong, significant deviations
 are observed in certain datasets, such as DERMATOLOGY and SEGMENT.
 For instance, in DERMATOLOGY, it exhibits an error rate of 52.92%, whereas
 the "PROPOSED" model achieves 20.54%, highlighting the substantial sensitivity
 of "BFGS" to the peculiarities of this dataset.
 In datasets with substantial variability in error rates, such as AUSTRALIAN
 and STATHEART, significant differentiation between algorithms is observed.
 In AUSTRALIAN, the "PROPOSED" model achieves the lowest error rate of 14.55%,
 while other algorithms exhibit error rates ranging from 32.21% to 38.13%.
 This difference underscores the superiority of the "PROPOSED" model in
 datasets that pose specific challenges to other algorithms.
 Similarly, in STATHEART, the "PROPOSED" model achieves one of the lowest
 error rates (17.93%), whereas other algorithms, such as "GENETIC," show
 rates as high as 27.25%.

 presents the performance of various machine learning models on regression
 datasets, as measured by absolute error values.
 Each column represents a specific model, while each row corresponds to
 a dataset and the absolute error value associated with each algorithm for
 that dataset.
 The last row provides the average error values for each algorithm, offering
 a general view of their overall performance.
 The analysis shows that the "PROPOSED" model achieves the lowest average
 error value (4.28) among all the algorithms, indicating its superior overall
 performance in terms of accuracy.
 Across multiple datasets, the "PROPOSED" model consistently achieves the
 smallest error values, such as in datasets like BL (0.001), MORTGAGE (0.023),
 and TREASURY (0.068).
 These results highlight its effectiveness across various regression problems.
 However, it is notable that in some datasets, such as FY (0.043) and HOUSING
 (15.47), the "PROPOSED" model does not have the lowest error values, though
 its performance remains competitive.
 On the other hand, the "BFGS" model records the highest average error value
 (30.29), reflecting its generally weaker performance across the datasets.
 Its errors are significantly higher in certain datasets, such as BASEBALL
 (119.63) and STOCK (302.43), indicating challenges in addressing regression
 tasks effectively in these cases.
 Despite this, "BFGS" shows competitive performance in a few instances,
 such as in the AIRFOIL dataset, where it achieves an error value of 0.003,
 close to that of the "PROPOSED" model.
 The "GENETIC" model has an average error value of 9.31, placing it among
 the mid-performing models in this analysis.
 It performs relatively well in datasets like MORTGAGE (2.41) and TREASURY
 (2.93), but struggles in others, such as BASEBALL (103.6) and PLASTIC (2.791).
 These results indicate variability in its performance depending on the
 dataset characteristics.
 The "ADAM" model, with an average error value of 22.46, shows moderate performan
ce overall.
 It has strong results in some datasets, such as AIRFOIL (0.005) and CONCRETE
 (0.078), but performs poorly in others, such as STOCK (180.89) and BASEBALL
 (77.9).
 This suggests that "ADAM" is sensitive to dataset-specific features and
 may not generalize well across all cases.
 The "RBF" model achieves an average error value of 10.02, demonstrating
 moderately good performance across the datasets.
 It performs particularly well in datasets like MORTGAGE (1.45) and LASER
 (0.03).
 However, it faces challenges in datasets such as BASEBALL (93.02) and STOCK
 (12.23), where its error values are notably higher.
 The "NNC" model has an average error value of 6.29, placing it as a strong
 performer, second only to the "PROPOSED" model in this analysis.
 It shows competitive results across many datasets, such as PL (0.047) and
 HO (0.015), but it is slightly outperformed by "PROPOSED" in most cases,
 including critical datasets like BL and TREASURY.
 Overall, the analysis reveals the "PROPOSED" model's superiority in minimizing
 absolute error across diverse regression datasets, as reflected by its
 lowest average error.
 The results also underscore the variability in performance among the other
 algorithms, suggesting that certain models may perform better in specific
 contexts but lack consistent efficacy across all datasets.

, the comparison of the proposed machine learning model (PROPOSED) with
 other models on classification datasets was conducted using a script in
 the R programming language, which evaluated the p-value to assess the statistic
al significance of performance differences.
 The p-value serves as a measure of the likelihood that observed results
 are due to random variation rather than genuine differences between the
 models.
 p-values below the commonly accepted threshold of 0.05 indicate that the
 differences are statistically significant and not due to random chance.
 The comparison between PROPOSED and the ADAM model yielded a p-value of
 1.9e-07, which is extremely low.
 This indicates that the performance difference between the two models is
 highly significant, rejecting the possibility that the superior performance
 of PROPOSED is due to random variability.
 This result highlights the clear advantage of PROPOSED over ADAM.
 In the case of PROPOSED versus BFGS, the p-value was 1.1e-08, even smaller
 than the comparison with ADAM.
 This extremely small p-value further underscores that PROPOSED significantly
 outperforms BFGS, demonstrating that the performance gap is exceptionally
 strong and statistically meaningful.
 For the comparison of PROPOSED with GENETIC, the p-value was 6.9e-08.
 Although this value is slightly higher than the previous ones, it is still
 extraordinarily low, indicating that PROPOSED's performance is clearly
 superior.
 This reinforces the consistency of PROPOSED when compared to models relying
 on genetic algorithms.
 The p-value for the comparison of PROPOSED with RBF was 1.9e-07, similar
 in magnitude to the comparison with ADAM.
 This consistency indicates that the superiority of PROPOSED over RBF is
 statistically significant, showcasing the proposed model's robust performance
 against a model with a different architecture.
 Finally, the comparison of PROPOSED with NNC produced a p-value of 4.3e-08.
 This very low value demonstrates the strong superiority of PROPOSED over
 a neural network classifier (NNC), further emphasizing the general observation
 that the proposed model performs better than the others, regardless of
 the specific technique employed by each competing model.
 Overall, the exceptionally low p-values for all comparisons provide evidence
 of the statistically significant superiority of PROPOSED compared to the
 other models.
 The results highlight that the performance of the proposed model is not
 only better but also consistently superior, with differences that are robust
 and highly reliable from a statistical perspective.

 on regression datasets was conducted using statistical analysis to determine
 the p-values, which measure the significance of performance differences
 between the models.
 A low p-value indicates that the observed differences are statistically
 significant and unlikely to have occurred by chance.
 The results reveal a consistent and robust superiority of PROPOSED over
 the other models.
 When comparing PROPOSED with ADAM, the p-value was 0.00013.
 This low value indicates a statistically significant difference in performance,
 confirming that the observed superiority of PROPOSED is unlikely to be
 due to random variation.
 In the case of BFGS, the p-value was even lower at 9.5e-07.
 This extremely small value strongly supports the conclusion that PROPOSED
 significantly outperforms BFGS, underscoring its robustness and reliability.
 The comparison of PROPOSED with GENETIC yielded a p-value of 0.0001.
 This result reaffirms the statistical significance of the performance gap
 between the two models, highlighting PROPOSED’s consistent advantage over
 GENETIC.
 For NEAT, the p-value was 0.0014, which, while slightly higher than the
 previous values, is still well below the threshold of 0.05.
 This demonstrates a statistically significant difference in favor of PROPOSED,
 confirming its superior performance even when compared to this specific
 algorithm.
 The comparison with RBF resulted in a p-value of 0.00042.
 This low value further solidifies the observation that PROPOSED consistently
 performs better than RBF, providing evidence of its strong adaptability
 and reliability across various regression datasets.
 Finally, the comparison with PRUNE yielded a p-value of 0.00011, which,
 like the others, is extremely low.
 This demonstrates that the performance differences between PROPOSED and
 PRUNE are statistically significant, further validating the superiority
 of the proposed model.
 Overall, the low p-values across all comparisons provide compelling evidence
 of the statistical significance of the performance advantages of PROPOSED
 over the other models in regression tasks.
 These results emphasize the consistency and reliability of the proposed
 model in delivering superior results across a wide range of regression
 datasets.

\begin_layout Standard
The article presents a method for constructing artificial neural networks
 by integrating Grammatical Evolution (GE) with a modified Genetic Algorithm
 (GA) to improve generalization properties and reduce overfitting.
 The method proves to be effective in designing neural network architectures
 and optimizing their parameters.
 The modified genetic algorithm avoids local minima during training and
 addresses overfitting by applying penalty factors to the fitness function,
 ensuring better generalization to unseen data.
 The method was evaluated on a variety of classification and regression
 datasets from diverse fields, including physics, chemistry, medicine, and
 economics.
 Comparative results indicate that the proposed method achieves lower error
 rates on average compared to traditional optimization and machine learning
 techniques, highlighting its stability and adaptability.
 The results, analyzed through statistical metrics such as p-values, provide
 strong evidence of the method’s superiority over competing models in both
 classification and regression tasks.
 A key innovation of the method is the combination of dynamic architecture
 generation and parameter optimization within a unified framework.
 This approach not only enhances performance but also reduces the computational
 complexity associated with manually designing neural networks.
 Additionally, the use of constraint techniques in the genetic algorithm
 ensures the preservation of the neural network structure while enabling
 controlled optimization of parameters.
 Future explorations could focus on testing the method on larger and more
 complex datasets, such as those encountered in image recognition, natural
 language processing, and genomics, to evaluate its scalability and effectivenes
s in real-world applications.
 Furthermore, the integration of other global optimization methods, such
 as Particle Swarm Optimization, Simulated Annealing, or Differential Evolution,
 could be considered to further enhance the algorithm’s robustness and convergen
ce speed.
 Concurrently, the inclusion of regularization techniques, such as dropout
 or batch normalization, could improve the method’s generalization capabilities
 even further.
 Reducing computational cost is another important area of investigation,
 and the method could be adapted to leverage parallel computing architectures,
 such as GPUs or distributed systems, making it feasible for training on
 large datasets or for real-time applications.
 Finally, customizing the grammar used in Grammatical Evolution based on
 the specific characteristics of individual fields could improve the method’s
 performance in specialized tasks, such as time-series forecasting or anomaly
 detection in cybersecurity.
