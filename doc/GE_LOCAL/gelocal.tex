\abstract{The Grammatical Evolution technique has been successfully applied
to a wide range of problems in various scientific fields. However,
in many cases, techniques that make use of Grammatical Evolution get
trapped in local minima of the objective problem and fail to reach
the optimal solution. One simple method to tackle such situations
is the usage of hybrid techniques, where local minimization algorithms
are used in conjunction with the main algorithm. However, Grammatical
Evolution is an integer optimization problem and, as a consequence,
techniques should be formulated that are applicable to it as well.
In current work, a modified version of the Simulated Annealing algorithm
is used as a local optimization procedure in Grammatical Evolution.
This approach was tested on the Constructed Neural Networks and a
remarkable improvement of the experimental results was shown, both
in classification data and in data fitting cases.\textbf{ }}

\section{Introduction}

Genetic Algorithms belong to the field of evolutionary techniques
\citep{ec_review} and were originally formulated by John Hollands
and his team \citep{Holland1}. Genetic Algorithms are initiated by
generating a series of random candidate solutions to an optimization
problem. These candidate solutions are called chromosomes, and they
iteratively undergo a series of operations that have their foundation
in physical processes, such as selection, crossover, and mutation
\citep{Stender,genetic1,genetic2}. Grammatical Evolution \citep{ge1}
is considered as a special case of genetic algorithms, where the chromosomes
are series of integer numbers.\textbf{ }Chromosomes in the Grammatical
Evolution process are rules for generating a Backus--Naur form (BNF)
grammar \citep{bnf1} and can be used to create functional programs
in any programming language. 

Grammatical Evolution has been applied on a wide series of real -
world applications, such as\textbf{ }function approximation\citep{ge_program1,ge_program2},
credit classification \citep{ge_credit}, network security and prevention
of attacks \citep{ge_intrusion}, monitoring of water quality \citep{ge_water},
modeling glycemia in humans \citep{ge_glykemia}, automatic design
of Ant algorithms \citep{ge_ant},\textbf{ }temperature prediction
in data centers \citep{ge_datacenter},\textbf{ }solving trigonometric
equations \citep{ge_trig},\textbf{ }composing music \citep{ge_music},\textbf{
}neural network construction \citep{ge_nn,ge_nn2},\textbf{ }producing
numeric constants \citep{ge_constant},\textbf{ }video games \citep{ge_pacman,ge_supermario},\textbf{
}energy demand estimation\citep{ge_energy},\textbf{ }combinatorial
optimization \citep{ge_comb}, cryptography \citep{ge_crypt}, evolving
of decision trees \citep{ge_decision},\textbf{ }automatic design
of analog electronic circuits \citep{ge_analog} etc.

The method of Grammatical Evolution has been extended by various researchers
during the last years and some examples of these extensions are the\textbf{
}Structured Grammatical Evolution \citep{ge_structured1,ge_structured2},\textbf{
}that applies a one-to-one mapping between the chromosomes and the
non-terminal symbols of the grammar,\textbf{ }the $\pi$Grammatical
Evolution method \citep{pge}, application of the Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO)
\citep{pso1} to produce programs with grammatical evolution denoted
as Grammatical Swarm \citep{ge_swarm1,ge_swarm2},\textbf{ }the Probabilistic
Grammatical Evolution \citep{probge} which introduced a new mapping
mechanism for the Grammatical Evolution method,\textbf{ }incorporation
of parallel programming techniques \citep{ge_par1,ge_par2}, usage
of Christiansen grammars \citep{ge_christiansen} etc. 

Also, a variety of software has been developed for Grammatical Evolution,
such as the GEVA \citep{ge_geva} that proposes a GUI application
for Grammatical Evolution, the gramEvol software \citep{ge_gramevol}
that provides a package in the R programming language, the GeLab \citep{ge_gelab}
that implements a Matlab toolbox for Grammatical Evolution, the GenClass
\citep{ge_genclass} software used to produce classification programs,
the QFc software \citep{ge_qfc} for feature construction etc.

Although the method of Grammatical Evolution has proven to be extremely
efficient, it can often get trapped in local minimum of the objective
problem and its performance may not be as expected. A common method
to get out of such situations is the use of local optimization techniques,
which have been applied many times in combination with Genetic Algorithms
\citep{ge_local1,ge_local2}. In the case of Grammatical Evolution
and due to the integral representation of the candidate solutions,
local optimization techniques are not directly applicable, such as,
for example, the BFGS method \citep{bfgs} and hence more suitable
methods should be adopted.\textbf{ }In this paper, an attempt is made
to improve upon the excellent results shown by Grammatical Evolution
in the past on a variety of problems by applying local optimization
techniques, periodically applied to randomly selected chromosomes
of Grammatical Evolution. The current work utilizes a modified version
of the Simulated Annealing method \citep{siman_main} as a local search
procedure. The method of Simulated Annealing has been utilized in
various cases, such as image processing \citep{siman_image}, protein
structure optimization \citep{siman_protein}, resource allocation
\citep{siman_resource}, convex optimization \citep{siman_convex},
deep learning \citep{siman_deep} etc. To verify the possibility of
the proposed methodology to improve the results of Grammatical Evolution,
the Neural Networks construction technique was chosen. This method
was initially provided in \citep{nnc_tsoulos} and it can estimate
the topology and the weights of neural networks using the Grammatical
Evolution procedure. This method was chosen to test the present methodology
because of its many applications. However, the technique proposed
in this paper will be able to be applied in the future in other cases
of using Grammatical Evolution. To evaluate the performance of the
modified technique it was evaluated on a extended series of classification
and regression problems found in the relevant literature and the results
seem to be promising.

In the same direction, many researchers have published papers in neural
network initialization or construction, such as the usage of decision
trees to initialize the weights of a neural network\citep{nninit1},\textbf{
}initialization of the weights using Cauchy's inequality \citep{weight_init2},
application of discriminant learning \citep{weight_init3}. Also,
the issue of constructing the structure of artificial neural networks
has been discussed in various papers, such as incorporation of genetic
algorithms\textbf{ }\citep{nngencon},\textbf{ }construction and pruning
of the weights \citep{nnprunncon}, application of of cellular automata
\citep{nncell} etc. 

This paper has the following sections: section \ref{sec:The-proposed-method}
the Grammatical Evolution procedure is discussed and the proposed
modification is described, the section \ref{sec:Results} presents
the datasets used in the experiments as well as the results from the
conducted experiments and finally the section \ref{sec:Conclusions}
provides some conclusions and guidelines for future work.

\section{The proposed method\label{sec:The-proposed-method}}

This section starts with a brief description of the Grammatical Evolution
process and the grammar used, then the modified Simulated Annealing
method is presented, and finally the artificial neural network construction
algorithm will be presented. 

\subsection{The Grammatical Evolution method \label{subsec:The-Grammatical-Evolution}}

The chromosomes of Grammatical Evolution stand for production rules
of the given BNF grammar. BNF grammars are usually defined as a tuple
\textbf{$G=\left(N,T,S,P\right)$}, where
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{$N$ }is the set of non-terminal symbols.
\item \textbf{$T$ }is the set of terminal symbols.\textbf{ }
\item $S$ represents that start symbol of the grammar with $S\in N$.
\item \textbf{$P$ }is the production rules of the grammar. Usually these
rules are in the form \textbf{$A\rightarrow a$ }or\textbf{ $A\rightarrow aB,\ A,B\in N,\ a\in T$.}
\end{itemize}
The BNF grammar is extended by using enumeration in the the production
rules. The grammar shown in Figure \ref{fig:BNF-grammar-of} is used
to construct artificial neural networks expressed in the form:
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)}\sigma\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{j}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)+j}+w_{(d+2)i}\right)\label{eq:nn}
\end{equation}
where the parameter $H$ represents the number of processing units
(hidden noes) for the neural network and the value $d$ represents
the of the vector $\overrightarrow{x}.$ Also, the vector $\overrightarrow{w}$
represents the vector of parameters for the neural network. The function
sig(x) represents the sigmoid function $\sigma(x)$ defined as: 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}\label{eq:sig}
\end{equation}

The notation \textless\textgreater{} is used for the non - terminal
symbols of the grammar. The sequence numbers of the production rules
are inside the parentheses of the extended grammar. The constant d
stands for the dimension of the provided dataset. The production of
valid expressions initiates from the symbol $S$ and using a series
of steps, creates a program by replacing non - terminal symbols with
the right hand of the selected production rule. The Grammatical Evolution
selects production rules using the following scheme:
\begin{itemize}
\item Obtain the next element V from the provided chromosome.
\item The production rule is selected according to the scheme 
\begin{equation}
\mbox{Rule}=V\ \mbox{mod}\ \mbox{NR}
\end{equation}
where NR is the total number of production rules for the current non
-- terminal symbol. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The modified Simulated Annealing algorithm}

The current work utilizes a modified version of the Simulated Annealing
algorithm as a local search procedure. Simulated Annealing was chosen
as a local search method, since it offers the possibility of representing
the considered solutions in an integer form, which is critical for
the Grammatical Evolution representation of chromosomes. In addition,
this method has been distinguished for its easy adaptation to a multitude
of problems but also for its ability to find the total minimum of
functions through the point acceptance mechanism at high temperatures.
In the present work, the Simulated Annealing will initiate from the
current representation of a chromosome and gradually try to find other
nearby representations that might lead to lower values of the fitness
value. The main steps of this procedure are shown in Algorithm \ref{alg:siman}.

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{The modified version of the Simulated Annealing algorithm.\label{alg:siman}}

\textbf{procedure} siman$\left(x_{0}\right)$
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} $k=0$, $T_{0}>0,\ \epsilon>0,$$r_{T}>0,\ r_{T}<1$..
\item \textbf{Set} $N_{eps}>0$, a positive integer indicated the number

\item \textbf{Set }$g$ and $R$, positive integer values.
\item \textbf{Set} $x_{b}=x_{0},f_{b}=f\left(x_{b}\right)$.

\item \textbf{For} $j=1\ldots g$
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} $p=\mbox{rand}\left(1,\mbox{size}\left(x_{0}\right)\right)$.
The variable $p$ indicates a randomly selected position in $y$.
\item \textbf{Set} $y_{p}=y_{p}+\mbox{rand}\left(-R,R\right)$
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{EndFor}
\item \textbf{If $f(y)\le f\left(x_{k}\right)$ then $x_{k+1}=y$}
\item \textbf{Else Set} $x_{k+1}=y$ with probability $\min\left\{ 1,\exp\left(-\frac{f(y)-f\left(x_{k}\right)}{T_{k}}\right)\right\} $
\item \textbf{If} $f\left(y\right)<f_{b}$ \textbf{then} $x_{b}=y,f_{b}=f(y)$.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{EndFor}
\item \textbf{Set} $T_{k+1}=T_{k}r_{T}$
\item \textbf{Set} $k=k+1$.
\item If $T_{k}\le\epsilon$ terminate
\item \textbf{Goto} step \ref{enu:For-}.
\item \textbf{Return }$x_{b}$
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{end} siman
\end{algorithm}
The method accepts the chromosome $x_{0}$ as a starting point and,
in each iteration, randomly generates chromosomes around it. The parameter
$g$ controls the number of changes that will be made to the chromosome
and the parameter $R$ controls the radius of these changes. The parameter
$T$ represents the temperature of the algorithm. The temperature
starts at extremely high values and progressively decreases linearly.
In the early stages and at high temperatures, the algorithm may accept
points that may have higher values of the fitness function, but as
the temperature decreases, this probability also decreases. The used
simulated annealing variant is also shown graphically as a flow chart
in Figure \ref{fig:saFlow}.

\subsection{The Neural Network Construction algorithm}

The main steps of the algorithm used to construct artificial neural
networks with Grammatical Evolution are listed below:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Initialization} step.
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Set} $N_{g}$ as the maximum number of generations allowed.
\item \textbf{Set} $N_{c}$ as the number of chromosomes. 
\item \textbf{Set} $p_{s}$ as the selection rate and $p_{m}$ as the mutation
rate. 
\item \textbf{Define} as $L_{i}$ the number of generations that should
elapse before applying the local optimization technique.
\item \textbf{Define} as $L_{c}$ the number of chromosomes involved in
the local search procedure.
\item \textbf{Initialize} the chromosomes. Each chromosome is considered
as a series of randomly initialized integers.
\item \textbf{Set} iter=0
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Genetic} step
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{For} $i=1,\ldots,N_{g}$ \textbf{do}
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Create} for every chromosome a neural network $C_{i}$ using
the Grammatical Evolution procedure of subsection \ref{subsec:The-Grammatical-Evolution}
and the associated grammar given in Figure \ref{fig:BNF-grammar-of}.
\item \textbf{Calculate} the fitness $f_{i}$ on the train set of the objective
problem as:
\begin{equation}
f_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{M}\left(C_{i}\left(\overrightarrow{x}_{j}\right)-t_{j}\right)^{2}\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}
where the set $\left(\overrightarrow{x_{j}},t_{j}\right),\ j=1,...,M$
is train dataset, with $t_{i}$ being the actual output for the point
$\overrightarrow{x_{i}}$ . 
\item \textbf{Perform} the selection procedure. Initially, the chromosomes
are sorted according to their fitness values. The best\textbf{ $\left(1-p_{s}\right)\times N_{c}$}
chromosomes are transferred to the next generation.\textbf{ }The remaining
chromosomes will be replaced by offsprings created during the crossover
procedure. 
\item \textbf{Perform} the crossover procedure. The crossover procedure
produces $p_{s}\times N_{c}$ offsprings. For every pair of produced
offsprings $\tilde{z}$ and $\tilde{w}$, two offsprings $(z,w)$.
The selection is performed using tournament selection. The new offsprings
are produced using the one - point crossover procedure. An example
of the one - point crossover procedure is shown in Figure \ref{fig:onePoint}.
\item \textbf{Perform} the mutation procedure. For each element of every
chromosome, a random number $r\in\left[0,1\right]$ is drawn. The
corresponding element is altered if $r\le p_{m}$.
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{EndFor} 
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Local Search Step }

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{If }$\mbox{iters}\ \mod\ L_{i}=0$ \textbf{Then}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Create }a set of randomly $L_{C}$ chosen chromosomes from
the genetic population. Denote this set as $L_{S}$ .
\item \textbf{For} every $X_{k}$ \textbf{in} $L_{S}$ apply the modified
Simulated Annealing algorithm given in Algorithm \ref{alg:siman}:
$X_{k}=\mbox{siman}\left(X_{k}\right)$
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\item \textbf{set} iter=iter+1. \textbf{If} iter$>$$N_{g}$ \textbf{goto}
Evaluation step else \textbf{goto} Genetic step.
\item \textbf{Evaluation} step
\begin{enumerate}
\item Get the chromosome with the lowest fitness value and create the associated
neural network $C^{*}$.
\item Evaluate the neural network $C^{*}$ in the test set of the underlying
dataset and report the results.
\end{enumerate}

used and, with the help of the programming environment Optimus. The
software is freely available from \url{https://github.com/itsoulos/OPTIMUS/}(
accessed on 20 March 2024 ). The experiments were conducted 30 times.
In every execution different seed was used for the random number generator
and the function drand48() of the C programming language was used.
The validation of the results was performed using the technique of
10 - fold cross validation. The average classification error is reported
for the case of classification datasets and the average regression
error for the case of regression datasets. These errors are measured
on the corresponding test set. The values for the experimental parameters
are displayed in Table \ref{tab:experValues}. The experimental results

The above techniques were used in the experiments as they are widespread
in machine learning, such as the Adam method \citep{adam1,adam2}
and because they have a similar complexity to the present technique,
such as Genetic Algorithms. As it is evident, the proposed modification
improves the efficiency of the proposed method in the majority of
used datasets. This improvement on some datasets could be as much
as an 80\% percent error reduction on the test set. In all cases,
the simple Neural Network Construction technique outperforms other
machine learning techniques and this is evident from the average result
(the last row in experimental tables). However, the proposed method
significantly reduces the classification error or the error in the
data fitting sets in most of the cases where it was used. In fact,
in order to show in which cases there was a reduction in the error,
bold marking was used in the tables of results. 

Figure \ref{fig:scatter_class} is a scatter plot that provides a
detailed comparative analysis of classification error percentages
for six distinct machine learning and optimization algorithms: ADAM,
NEAT, GENETIC, RBF, NNC, and NNC-S. Each point on the plot represents
the outcome of an individual run of a model, thus showcasing the range
of variation in the error rates associated with these classification
methods. The vertical dispersion of points for each method reflects
the spread of error rates, which is critical for evaluating the reliability
of each algorithm. The medians of these error rates are indicated
by horizontal lines intersecting the clusters of dots, offering a
snapshot of each algorithm's central tendency in performance. The
asterisk-based notation above the clusters denotes statistical significance
levels: one asterisk ({*}) signifies a p-value less than 0.05, two
asterisks ({*}{*}) denote p \textless{} 0.01, three asterisks ({*}{*}{*})
represent p \textless{} 0.001, and four asterisks ({*}{*}{*}{*}) indicate
an extremely low p-value of less than 0.0001, suggesting strong evidence
against the null hypothesis. Of note is the performance of the NNC-S
method, which not only shows a significantly lower median error rate
when compared to the NNC method but also displays a notably tighter
cluster of data points. This implies that the NNC-S method not only
tends to be more accurate on average but also provides greater consistency
in its error rates across different runs, underscoring its robustness
as a classification tool.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=2]{figure_class}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Scatter plot illustrating the variability and median classification
error rates for six machine learning algorithms, with statistical
significance denoted by asterisks. The NNC-S method demonstrates notably
lower error rates, as evidenced by the high statistical significance
relative to other methods, which may indicate its superior performance
in classification tasks.\label{fig:scatter_class}}

\end{figure}
Building on the previous analysis of classification methods, Figure
\ref{fig:scatter_regression} extends the evaluation to regression
algorithms, providing a comparative study of regression error rates
for the same six methods: ADAM, NEAT, GENETIC, RBF, NNC, and NNC-S.
Each data point reflects the regression error from a specific trial,
with the array of points for each method revealing the range of performance
outcomes. The median error rates are again represented by horizontal
lines across the clusters of dots, serving as a summary statistic
that facilitates a direct comparison of the method's central performance
trends. The notation of statistical significance is consistent with
the previous figure, where asterisks convey the p-value levels, identifying
statistically meaningful differences in performance between the methods.

This plot reveals that the NNC-S method maintains its superior performance
in the context of regression tasks, demonstrating lower median regression
errors compared to the other methods. Significantly, it achieves a
markedly lower median regression error than its predecessor, NNC,
as indicated by the blue dots and supported by the three asterisks
({*}{*}{*}). This pattern of results underscores the broader applicability
of the NNC-S method's local optimization enhancements, not only in
classification accuracy but also in reducing regression errors.

\caption{Scatter plot of regression error rates for various regression methods,
demonstrating the distribution, median error rates, and statistical
significance of differences in performance. The NNC-S method, shows
statistically significant improvements in accuracy over the NNC method,
underlining the efficacy of local optimization enhancements in regression
tasks. The y-axis is presented on a logarithmic scale to clearly visualize
the range of error magnitudes across methods.\label{fig:scatter_regression}}

\end{figure}

Additionally, the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed
method was evaluated by performing additional experiments with different
values for the critical parameter $g$ of the suggested Simulated
Annealing variant. This parameter is used to control the number of
random changes performed on any given chromosome. The experimental
results in the classification datasets are shown in Table \ref{tab:g_experiments}.
Clearly, no significant variation in the performance of the proposed
technique occurs when this critical parameter is varied.

Continuing from the previous analysis, Figure \ref{fig:scatter_g}
presents the classification error rates for variations of the NNC-S
algorithm with differing values of the parameter $g$. The plot aims
to evaluate whether changes in the parameter $g$ led to statistically
significant differences in the algorithm's classification performance.
The horizontal bars on the plot indicate the median classification
error for each variation of the NNC-S method, providing a clear comparison
across the different parameter values. The statistical annotations
(\textquotedbl ns\textquotedbl{} for not significant, \textquotedbl{*}{*}”
for p \textless{} 0.01, and \textquotedbl{*}{*}{*}\textquotedbl{}
for p \textless{} 0.001) are used to denote the statistical significance
of the differences between the groups. It appears that some variations,
particularly between NNC-S (g=2) and NNC-S (g=5), as well as between
NNC-S (g=10) and NNC-S (g=20), do not show significant differences
in performance (denoted by \textquotedbl ns\textquotedbl ). In contrast,
other comparisons do reveal significant differences, suggesting that
certain values of g can indeed impact the classification error rates
of the NNC-S algorithm.

algorithm's classification errors, revealing that while some parameter
adjustments do not significantly affect performance, others result
in noticeable differences, as indicated by the statistical significance
annotations.\label{fig:scatter_g}}

\end{figure}
In addition, in the graph of the figure \ref{fig:Timecomparison},
a comparison is made for the average execution time of each experiment
for the classification datasets. The comparison was made between the
initial method (denoted as NNC in the graph) as well as the various
cases of the proposed technique by changing the parameter $g$ to
5, 10 and 20. As expected, adding the local minimization technique
to the Grammatical Evolution method significantly increases the execution
time of the method, however this increase remains almost constant
for different values of the critical parameter $g$. Moreover, by
using parallel techniques that appear in the relevant literature this
increase in execution time could be reduced.

Furthermore, another experiment was executed by varying the parameter
$R$ of the proposed Simulated Annealing variant. This parameter controls
the range of changes performed in any given chromosome. The results
for this experiment are shown in Table \ref{tab:r_exper}. And this
time the method appeared quite robust in its performance, without
large variations in the error as measured in the test set.

As a practical application of the suggested method, consider the dataset
proposed in \citep{alcohol}, which relates the alcohol consumption
and EEG recordings. The proposed method was applied on this dataset
and it is compared against the original Neural Network Construction
technique and the results are outlined in Figure \ref{fig:alcohol}.

\begin{figure}[H]

\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{alcohol}

\caption{Comparison between the proposed method and the original Neural Construction
method for the alcohol consumption dataset.\label{fig:alcohol}}

\end{figure}
Once again, the present method outperforms the original artificial
neural network construction technique and the performance appears
to be stable as the critical parameter $g$ grows. 

\section{Conclusions\label{sec:Conclusions}}

In the current work, an extension of the original Grammatical Evolution
has been proposed, which was applied in the Neural Construction method.
In this extension, an application of a modified optimization method
was suggested, in order to improve the efficiency of the underlying
technique. The proposed optimization algorithm was a variant of the
Simulated Annealing method, that was applied on a series of chromosomes,
that was randomly from the Grammatical Evolution procedure. This method
was chosen because of its widespread use in many applications but
because of its ability to handle integer representations, since the
chromosomes in Grammatical Evolution are vectors of integers. Of course,
other local optimization techniques could be incorporated, such as
tabu search \citep{tabu} or hill climbing \citep{hill} as feature
extensions of the proposed method.

The proposed modification was applied to the Neural Network Construction
method and its efficiency was measured on some classification and
regression datasets commonly used. Based on the experimental results,
it has become clear that the proposed variant significantly improves
the performance of the technique both on classification datasets and
on data fitting datasets. Also, the effectiveness and the robustness
of the proposed modification were measured using experiments with
different values of some critical parameters of the current Simulated
Annealing variant. These experiments indicated that the method tends
to be robust, since the experimental results does not depend on the
selection of any critical parameter of the Simulated Annealing variant.

The present modification could be applied to other techniques that
use Grammatical Evolution without significant differences and, moreover,
it could also be used to optimize functions either without constraints
or with constraints in similar techniques that have been proposed
in recent years. However, as was seen from the experimental results,
the addition of the Simulated Annealing technique significantly increases
the required execution time and it is necessary to use techniques
that are not particularly demanding in time or to search for termination
techniques of the proposed Simulated Annealing variant that take advantage
of its particular characteristics. Also, a field of research could
be the search for more effective techniques to reduce the critical
temperature factor used in the Simulated Annealing. 

Future work may include application of the local search procedure
in other Grammatical Evolution applications, such as feature construction,
creation of classification rules etc. Also, the proposed process can
be significantly accelerated by the use of parallel optimization techniques
\citep{psa}, which take advantage of modern computational structures.
