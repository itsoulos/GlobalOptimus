\begin_layout Abstract
The Grammatical Evolution technique has been successfully applied to a wide
 range of problems in various scientific fields.
 However, in many cases, techniques that make use of Grammatical Evolution
 get trapped in local minima of the objective problem and fail to reach
 the optimal solution.
 One simple method to tackle such situations is the usage of hybrid techniques,
 where local minimization algorithms are used in conjunction with the main
 algorithm.
 However, Grammatical Evolution is an integer optimization problem and,
 as a consequence, techniques should be formulated that are applicable to
 it as well.
 In current work, a modified version of the Simulated Annealing algorithm
 is used as a local optimization procedure in Grammatical Evolution.
 This approach was tested on the Constructed Neural Networks and a remarkable
 improvement of the experimental results was shown, both in classification
 data and in data fitting cases.

Although the method of Grammatical Evolution has proven to be extremely
 efficient, it can often get trapped in local minimum of the objective problem
 and its performance may not be as expected.
 A common method to get out of such situations is the use of local optimization
 techniques, which have been applied many times in combination with Genetic
 Algorithms 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ge_local1,ge_local2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the case of Grammatical Evolution and due to the integral representation
 of the candidate solutions, local optimization techniques are not directly
 applicable, such as, for example, the BFGS method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bfgs"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and hence more suitable methods should be adopted.

\series bold
 
\series default
In this paper, an attempt is made to improve upon the excellent results
 shown by Grammatical Evolution in the past on a variety of problems by
 applying local optimization techniques, periodically applied to randomly
 selected chromosomes of Grammatical Evolution.
 The current work utilizes a modified version of the Simulated Annealing
 method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "siman_main"

\end_inset

 as a local search procedure.
 The method of Simulated Annealing has been utilized in various cases, such
 as image processing

 To verify the possibility of the proposed methodology to improve the results
 of Grammatical Evolution, the Neural Networks construction technique was
 chosen.
 This method was initally provided in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nnc_tsoulos"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and it can estimate the topology and the weights of neural networks using
 the Grammatical Evolution procedure.
 This method was chosen to test the present methodology because of its many
 applications.
 However, the technique proposed in this paper will be able to be applied
 in the future in other cases of using Grammatical Evolution.
 To evaluate the performance of the modified technique it was evaluated
 on a extended series of classification and regression problems found in
 the relevant literature and the results seem to be promising.

\end_inset

( accessed on 20 March 2024 ).
 The experiments were conducted 30 times.
 In every execution different seed was used for the random number generator
 and the function drand48() of the C programming language was used.
 The validation of the results was performed using the technique of 10 -
 fold cross validation.
 The average classification error is reported for the case of classification
 datasets and the average regression error for the case of regression datasets.
 These errors are measured on the corresponding test set.
 The values for the experimental parameters are displayed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 The experimental results for the classification datasets are outlined in
 the table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

As it is evident, the proposed modification improves the efficiency of the
 proposed method in the majority of used datasets.
 This improvement on some datasets could be as much as an 80% percent error
 reduction on the test set.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:scatter_class"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 is a scatter plot that provides a detailed comparative analysis of classificati
on error percentages for six distinct machine learning and optimization
 algorithms: ADAM, NEAT, GENETIC, RBF, NNC, and NNC-S.
 Each point on the plot represents the outcome of an individual run of a
 model, thus showcasing the range of variation in the error rates associated
 with these classification methods.
 The vertical dispersion of points for each method reflects the spread of
 error rates, which is critical for evaluating the reliability of each algorithm.
 The medians of these error rates are indicated by horizontal lines intersecting
 the clusters of dots, offering a snapshot of each algorithm's central tendency
 in performance.
 The asterisk-based notation above the clusters denotes statistical significance
 levels: one asterisk (*) signifies a p-value less than 0.05, two asterisks
 (**) denote p < 0.01, three asterisks (***) represent p < 0.001, and four
 asterisks (****) indicate an extremely low p-value of less than 0.0001,
 suggesting strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
 Of note is the performance of the NNC-S method, which not only shows a
 significantly lower median error rate when compared to the NNC method but
 also displays a notably tighter cluster of data points.
 This implies that the NNC-S method not only tends to be more accurate on
 average but also provides greater consistency in its error rates across
 different runs, underscoring its robustness as a classification tool.

 The NNC-S method demonstrates notably lower error rates, as evidenced by
 the high statistical significance relative to other methods, which may
 indicate its superior performance in classification tasks.

Building on the previous analysis of classification methods, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:scatter_regression"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 extends the evaluation to regression algorithms, providing a comparative
 study of regression error rates for the same six methods: ADAM, NEAT, GENETIC,
 RBF, NNC, and NNC-S.
 Each data point reflects the regression error from a specific trial, with
 the array of points for each method revealing the range of performance
 outcomes.
 The median error rates are again represented by horizontal lines across
 the clusters of dots, serving as a summary statistic that facilitates a
 direct comparison of the methods' central performance trends.
 The notation of statistical significance is consistent with the previous
 figure, where asterisks convey the p-value levels, identifying statistically
 meaningful differences in performance between the methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This plot reveals that the NNC-S method maintains its superior performance
 in the context of regression tasks, demonstrating lower median regression
 errors compared to the other methods.
 Significantly, it achieves a markedly lower median regression error than
 its predecessor, NNC, as indicated by the blue dots and supported by the
 three asterisks (***).
 This pattern of results underscores the broader applicability of the NNC-S
 method's local optimization enhancements, not only in classification accuracy
 but also in reducing regression errors.

Additionally, the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed method
 was evaluated by performing additional experiments with different values
 for the critical parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 of the suggested Simulated Annealing variant.
 This parameter is used to control the number of random changes performed
 on any given chromosome.
 The experimental results in the classification datasets are shown in Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 Clearly, no significant variation in the performance of the proposed technique
 occurs when this critical parameter is varied.

Continuing from the previous analysis, Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:scatter_g"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 presents the classification error rates for variations of the NNC-S algorithm
 with differing values of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 The plot aims to evaluate whether changes in the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 led to statistically significant differences in the algorithm's classification
 performance.
 The horizontal bars on the plot indicate the median classification error
 for each variation of the NNC-S method, providing a clear comparison across
 the different parameter values.
 The statistical annotations ("ns" for not significant, "**” for p < 0.01,
 and "***" for p < 0.001) are used to denote the statistical significance
 of the differences between the groups.
 It appears that some variations, particularly between NNC-S (g=2) and NNC-S
 (g=5), as well as between NNC-S (g=10) and NNC-S (g=20), do not show significan
t differences in performance (denoted by "ns").
 In contrast, other comparisons do reveal significant differences, suggesting
 that certain values of g can indeed impact the classification error rates
 of the NNC-S algorithm.

Furthermore, another experiment was executed by varying the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 of the proposed Simulated Annealing variant.
 This parameter controls the range of changes performed in any given chromosome.
 The results for this experiment are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:r_exper"

\end_inset

.
 And this time the method appeared quite robust in its performance, without
 large variations in the error as measured in the test set.

\begin_layout Standard
In the current work, an extension of the original Grammatical Evolution
 has been proposed, which was applied in the Neural Construction method.
 In this extension, an application of a modified optimization method was
 suggested, in order to improve the efficiency of the underlying technique.
 The proposed optimization algorithm was a variant of the Simulated Annealing
 method, that was applied on a series of chromosomes, that was randomly
 from the Grammatical Evolution procedure.
 This method was chosen because of its widespread use in many applications
 but because of its ability to handle integer representations, since the
 chromosomes in Grammatical Evolution are vectors of integers.
 Of course, other local optimization techniques could be incorporated, such
 as tabu search 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 or hill climbing 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hill"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 as feature extensions of the proposed method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed modification was applied to the Neural Network Construction
 method and its efficiency was measured on some classification and regression
 datasets commonly used.
 Based on the experimental results, it has become clear that the proposed
 variant significantly improves the performance of the technique both on
 classification datasets and on data fitting datasets.
 Also, the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed modification
 were measured using experiments with different values of some critical
 parameters of the current Simulated Annealing variant.
 These experiments indicated that the method tends to be rubost, since the
 experimental results does not depend on the selection of any critical parameter
 of the Simulated Annealing variant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Future work may include application of the local search procedure in other
 Grammatical Evolution applications, such as feature construction, creation
 of classification rules etc.
 Also, the proposed process can be significantly accelerated by the use
 of parallel optimization techniques
