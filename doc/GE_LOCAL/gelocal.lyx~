% For posting an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use "preprints" as the journal and change "submit" to "accept". The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

\begin_layout Abstract
The Grammatical Evolution technique has been successfully applied to a wide
 range of problems in various scientific fields.
 However, in many cases techniques that make use of Grammatical Evolution
 get trapped in local minima of the objective problem and fail to reach
 the optimal solution.
 One simple method to tackle such situations is the usage of hybrid techniques,
 where local minimization algorithms are used with conjuction with the main
 algorithm.
 Although, Grammatical Evolution is an integer optimization problem and
 as a consequence techniques should be formulated that are applicable to
 it as well.
 In the current work, a modified version of the Simulated Annealing algorithm
 is used as local optimization procedure in the Grammatical Evolution.
 This approach was tested on the Constructed Neural Networks and a remarkable
 improvement of the experimental results was shown, both in classification
 data and in data fitting cases.
