\begin_layout Abstract
Artificial neural networks are reliable machine learning models that have been applied to a multitude of practical and scientific applications in recent decades.
 Among these applications there are examples from the areas of physics,
 chemistry,
 medicine,
 etc.
 For their effective application to these problems,
 it is necessary to adapt their parameters using optimization techniques.
 However,
 in order to be effective,
 optimization techniques must know the range of values for the parameters of the artificial neural network,
 so that they can adequately train the artificial neural network.
 In most cases,
 this is not possible,
 as these ranges are also significantly affected by the inputs to the artificial neural network from the objective problem it is called upon to solve.
 This situation usually results in artificial neural networks becoming trapped in local minima of the error function or,
 even worse,
 in the phenomenon of overfitting,
 where although the training error achieves low values,
 the artificial neural network exhibits low performance in the corresponding test set.
 The present work proposes the introduction of an additional stage in the training of artificial neural networks before the application of the optimization method,
 in which stage a method based on simulated annealing is used to effectively identify the optimal value interval for the parameters of the artificial neural network.
 Subsequently,
 the optimization method will adjust the parameters of the artificial neural network within the optimal value interval of the first stage.
 The proposed method has been successfully applied to a wide range of classification and regression problems and comparative results are presented in detail in the present work.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Artificial neural networks are among the most commonly used machine learning models for solving classification and regression tasks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nn1,nn2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 These models are typically formulated as functions 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 where the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}$
\end_inset

 represents the input pattern and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$
\end_inset

 denotes the set of trainable parameters of the neural network.
 Model training is achieved by minimizing the training error,
 which is defined by the following expression:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mbox{E}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x}_{i},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,...,M$
\end_inset

 stands for the associated training set of the objective problem.
 In this set each value 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the desired output for the pattern 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x_{i}}$
\end_inset

.
 As suggested in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nnc"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 a neural network could be expressed as a function with the following definition:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)}\sigma\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{j}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)+j}+w_{(d+2)i}\right)\label{eq:nn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this equation,
 the value 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 represents the number of desired processing units.
 Also,
 the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)$
\end_inset

 stands for the the sigmoid function,
 expressed as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}\label{eq:sig}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The total number of parameters for neural network can be calculated as 
\begin_inset Formula $n=(d+2)H$
\end_inset

,
 using the equation

Moreover,
 a series of alternative activation functions has been proposed in the related literature,
 such as the tanh expressed as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mbox{tanh}\left(x\right)=\frac{e^{2x}+1}{e^{2x}-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Additionally,
 Guarnieri et al proposed the incorporation of an adaptive spline function as the activation function

 or sometimes are prone to the issue of overifitting.
 In overfitting,
 the neural network demonstrates degraded performance when applied to data that were not present during the training phase.
 The overfitting issue has been studied by various researches during the past years and a variety of algorithms have been proposed for this problem,
 such as the weight sharing method

The current work introduces a new method,
 that is based on the Simulated Annealing approach to identify the optimal range of values for the parameters of the neural network before the incorporation of the training method.
 The first phase method creates various test value intervals which it adjusts appropriately through the usage of an innovative technique based on Simulated Annealing.
 This method starts from an initial range of values \SpecialChar allowbreak
\SpecialChar allowbreak
which can be expanded or contracted in an attempt to avoid the phenomenon of overfitting.
 After the end of the first phase,
 the artificial neural network is trained within the optimal value interval identified in the first phase using any optimization technique.

 The behavior of this algorithm is controlled by a positive parameter that resembles the annealing temperature in physics.
 At high temperatures the algorithm performs a wider search in the value range of the objective problem and as the temperature decreases the algorithm focuses on some possible minima of the objective function.
 Temperature reduction can be achieved by different cooling mechanisms,
 as reported in the relevant literature

The proposed modification constructs candidate intervals for the neural network parameters and assesses each interval by generating multiple random parameter configurations within it.
 The mean error of the resulting neural networks is then used as the performance measure for the corresponding interval.
 Also,
 To avoid the phenomenon of overtraining,

 is used and the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right),a\right)$
\end_inset

 introduced in that publication is used here also.
 To calculate this quantity,
 it is assumed that the sigmoid function with the following definition is used as the activation function of the artificial neural network:
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}

As can be observed from both the analytical expression and the corresponding figure,
 the function exhibits rapid saturation,
 asymptotically approaching 1 for large positive values of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and converging to 0 for large negative values.
 This saturation behavior significantly limits the function’s generalization capacity,
 since substantial variations in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 result in only marginal changes in the output of the sigmoid function.
 The quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right),a\right)$
\end_inset

 was introduced in that paper can be used to measure this effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "alg:CalculationBound"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The resulting function can be employed as a regularization mechanism to mitigate overfitting by constraining the neural network parameters within problem-dependent intervals.
 The user-defined parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 serves as an upper bound on the input of the sigmoid unit.
 When this bound is exceeded,
 the network is likely to exhibit diminished generalization performance,
 as the sigmoid function enters a saturation regime in which variations in the input no longer produce meaningful changes in the output.

 The behavior of the proposed method is controlled by a variable representing the temperature.
 At high temperatures the method searches a wider range of the problem and may generate value ranges for the neural network parameters that will have a large range.
 However,
 as the temperature drops,
 the method focuses on value ranges that are more promising.
 The main steps of this method are given in Algorithm

 This procedure is applied in every element of each chromosome,
 where a random number 
\begin_inset Formula $r\in[0,1]$

 is selected.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $r\le p_{m}$
\end_inset

 then the corresponding element 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{ij}$
\end_inset

 of chromosome 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}$

 is changed using the following equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

Experimental results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental software was implemented in C++ using the freely available Optimus framework 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "optimus"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 Each experimental configuration was executed 30 independent times,
 with a distinct random seed assigned to each run.
 To ensure a reliable evaluation of the results,
 the ten-fold cross-validation methodology was employed.
 All experiments were repeated 30 times,
 and performance was quantified using the mean classification error for the classification datasets and the mean regression error for the regression datasets.
 The classification error is calculated using the following equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{C}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=100\times\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\left(\mbox{class}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)-y_{i}\right)}{K}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here the set 
\begin_inset Formula $T=\left\{ x_{i},y_{i}\right\} ,\ i=1,\ldots,K$
\end_inset

 represents the associated test set of the objective problem.
 Similarly,
 the regression error for the test set is given from the following equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{R}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}}{K}
\end{equation}

 reports classification error rates (lower is better) across 34 datasets for seven learning/training approaches,
 with the last row providing the average error per method.
 At the aggregate level,
 the proposed approach (PROPOSED) is clearly the best performer,
 achieving an average error of 20.57%,
 while the second-best average is obtained by GENETIC at 26.55%.
 This corresponds to an absolute improvement of 5.97 percentage points,
 i.e.,
 an approximately 22.5% relative error reduction compared to GENETIC.
 The advantage remains consistent against the remaining baselines:
 relative to PRUNE (27.44%) the improvement is 6.87 points (~25.0% relative reduction),
 relative to RBF (29.42%) it is 8.85 points (~30.1%),
 relative to NEAT (32.11%) it is 11.54 points (~35.9%),
 and relative to ADAM/BFGS (34.48%/34.34%) it is about 13.9 points (~40% relative reduction).
 In addition,
 when considering variability across heterogeneous datasets,
 PROPOSED exhibits the lowest dispersion of errors (standard deviation ≈ 14.31),
 which is consistent with more stable behavior across different classification tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a per-dataset perspective (minimum error per row),
 PROPOSED attains the best result on 23 out of 34 datasets (≈67.6%),
 indicating that its superiority is systematic rather than driven by a small subset of cases.
 Moreover,
 PROPOSED ranks within the top two methods on 31/34 datasets and within the top three on 33/34 datasets,
 highlighting strong rank consistency.
 In the datasets where PROPOSED is not the best,
 it is often very close to the winner (e.g.,
 SPIRAL:
 44.90% vs 44.87%,
 ALCOHOL:
 15.99% vs 15.75%,
 POPFAILURES:
 5.06% vs 4.79%),
 with a limited number of more pronounced gaps such as ECOLI (49.67% vs 43.44%) and DERMATOLOGY (14.83% vs 9.02%).
 Conversely,
 there are datasets where PROPOSED achieves large margins over the second-best method,
 notably SEGMENT (38.85% vs 49.75%),
 HEARTATTACK (18.97% vs 29.00%),
 HEART (18.37% vs 27.21%),
 and WINE (8.12% vs 16.62%).
 Overall,
 Table 2 supports that the proposed method delivers the best mean performance,
 the best average ranking,
 and the highest number of dataset-level wins,
 with only sporadic cases where alternative methods outperform it.

 were obtained via R-based analyses on the classification experiment tables,
 aiming to verify that the observed performance differences are statistically reliable rather than due to random variation.
 The overall Friedman test yields p=
\begin_inset Formula $2.89×10^{-11}$
\end_inset

,
 which is extremely small and therefore strongly rejects the null hypothesis that all methods perform equivalently.
 This indicates that,
 across the set of datasets,
 genuine performance differences exist among the considered models and motivates post-hoc pairwise comparisons against the proposed approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pairwise results confirm that the proposed method differs significantly from each baseline.
 In particular,
 the comparisons ADAM vs PROPOSED and BFGS vs PROPOSED produce p=
\begin_inset Formula $1.78×10^{-8}$
\end_inset

 and p=
\begin_inset Formula $5.17×10^{-9}$
\end_inset

,
 respectively,
 providing very strong evidence of a difference (well beyond the p<0.0001 threshold).
 The PRUNE vs PROPOSED comparison is also highly decisive (p=
\begin_inset Formula $2.07×10^{-5}$
\end_inset

,
 i.e.,
 p<0.0001).
 For GENETIC and RBF,
 the p-values are larger but remain below 0.01 (p=0.0076 and p=0.0085),
 which corresponds to a “highly significant” difference.
 Overall,
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 supports that the proposed model’s superiority is not only reflected in the raw error rates,
 but is also substantiated by strong statistical significance against all competing baselines.

\begin_layout Standard
In the regression part of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expRegression"

caps "false"

\end_inset

,
 errors are reported in absolute units and span a very wide dynamic range (from approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 up to hundreds),
 meaning that a few large-error cases can dominate average performance.
 Under this regime,
 the proposed approach (PROPOSED) delivers the most favorable aggregate outcome,
 with the lowest mean error of 5.33,
 compared to 9.31 for GENETIC and 10.02 for RBF.
 The reduction from 9.31 to 5.33 corresponds to a 3.98-unit absolute gain,
 i.e.,
 about a 42.8% relative improvement over the best competing average (GENETIC).
 Importantly,
 PROPOSED also exhibits the strongest robustness against extreme values,
 showing the smallest variability across datasets (standard deviation ≈ 13.75).
 This point matters in regression benchmarking because heavy-tailed errors can materially affect the mean and may reveal instability.
 In contrast,
 ADAM and BFGS show very large worst-case outcomes (e.g.,
 180.89 and 302.43 on STOCK),
 which inflates their averages (22.46 and 30.29,
 respectively) and indicates sensitivity to high-scale or difficult regression settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at dataset-level outcomes (row-wise minima),
 PROPOSED attains the best result or ties for best on 14 out of 21 regression datasets,
 including 11 outright wins and 3 top ties.
 Beyond wins,
 its rank consistency is strong:
 PROPOSED falls within the top two methods on 18/21 datasets and within the top three on 20/21 datasets,
 suggesting that its advantage is not driven by a small number of isolated successes.
 Several datasets show substantive margins rather than marginal differences,
 including HOUSING (26.76 vs 43.26 for the runner-up),
 TREASURY (0.20 vs 2.02),
 MORTGAGE (0.12 vs 1.45),
 and BASEBALL (58.86 vs 77.90).
 The few cases where PROPOSED is not the best do not overturn the overall pattern:
 on ABALONE it is essentially tied with the best value (4.31 vs 4.30),
 BL is dominated by RBF (0.013),
 and FY is the only dataset where PROPOSED falls outside the top three,
 yet the absolute gap remains small (0.057 vs 0.038).
 Overall,
 Table 2 indicates that the proposed method achieves the strongest balance of low mean error,
 frequent top performance,
 and reduced exposure to severe outliers,
 which is particularly relevant for regression evaluation across heterogeneous datasets.

 reports statistical significance levels for the regression experiments,
 based on p-values computed through R scripts.
 The overall Friedman test yields p=
\begin_inset Formula $1.55×10^{-4}$
\end_inset

,
 which is well below 0.001,
 indicating that the compared methods do not behave equivalently across the regression datasets and that genuine performance differences exist.
 This justifies examining post-hoc pairwise comparisons against the proposed method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pairwise outcomes reveal a more mixed pattern than in the classification case,
 which is expected in regression settings where absolute-error scales can vary substantially across datasets.
 The strongest evidence of a difference in favor of the proposed approach is observed against BFGS (p=
\begin_inset Formula $3.35×10^{-4}$
\end_inset

),
 which falls in the extremely significant range (p<0.001).
 The comparison with GENETIC yields p=0.0113,
 i.e.,
 significant at the 0.05 level but not highly significant,
 implying a reliable yet weaker separation.
 In contrast,
 ADAM,
 RBF,
 and PRUNE produce p-values of 0.0585,
 0.1462,
 and 0.0898,
 respectively,
 all above 0.05,
 meaning that differences versus the proposed method are not statistically supported under the standard threshold.
 Overall,

 suggests that,
 for regression,
 the proposed method exhibits statistically substantiated advantages primarily over BFGS and,
 to a lesser extent,
 over GENETIC,
 while differences relative to the remaining baselines are not strong enough to rule out random experimental variability.

An additional experiment was performed to determine the stability of the proposed technique to changes in the perturbation factor 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 The experimental results for this experiment on the classification datasets are depicted in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Table

\end_inset

 provides a targeted sensitivity study of the proposed classifier with respect to the crossover-related parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

,
 reporting error rates (lower is better) on 34 classification datasets for three settings (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01,
 0.02,
 0.05).
 The averages at the bottom of the table are extremely close,
 yet they consistently favor 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05:
 20.33% versus 20.54% for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02 and 20.57% for
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01.
 The absolute gain relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01 is only 0.24 percentage points (approximately a 1.2% relative reduction),
 which suggests that the method’s performance is not highly sensitive to moderate changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 This limited sensitivity is also reflected by the central tendency and spread:
 the medians are nearly identical (about 17.75%,
 17.85%,
 and 17.90%),
 and the dispersion across datasets remains comparable for all three settings (standard deviation around 14%),
 indicating that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

 mainly shifts performance on particular datasets rather than reshaping the overall distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more informative view emerges from the dataset-wise minima.
 The setting 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 achieves the lowest error on 13 out of 34 datasets and ties for best on one additional dataset (STUDENT),
 i.e.,
 14/34 top outcomes.
 In comparison,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01 is best on 11 datasets,
 while 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02 is best on 9 datasets plus one top tie.
 Hence,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 is the strongest default choice in terms of both average performance and frequency of best results,
 but the table also highlights clear dataset-specific preferences.
 For instance,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 yields notable improvements on LIVERDISORDER (33.71% to 30.26%),
 APPENDICITIS (15.50% to 12.40%),
 DERMATOLOGY (14.83% to 11.92%),
 AUSTRALIAN (27.22% to 24.58%),
 and ECOLI (49.67% to 47.15%).
 Conversely,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01 is distinctly advantageous on SEGMENT (38.85% vs 44.21-44.72),
 SPIRAL (44.90% vs 45.29-47.77),
 and WINE (8.12% vs 10.65-11.23).
 Overall,
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expClassPC"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 indicates that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

 acts as a fine-grained control parameter:
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 optimizes mean behavior and the count of best-case outcomes,
 while smaller values such as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01 can be preferable for specific datasets.

 indicates that varying the pc parameter does not produce statistically detectable differences in the proposed model’s performance on the classification datasets.
 The overall Friedman test yields p=0.6556,
 hence the null hypothesis of equivalent settings is not rejected.
 Moreover,
 the pairwise comparisons 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 both give p=1,
 confirming no evidence of separation.
 Therefore,
 within the tested range,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

 behaves as a practically neutral tuning choice,
 and the selection can be guided by secondary considerations (e.g.,
 stability or computational cost).
 In summary,
 the three pc settings are statistically indistinguishable for classification under the reported tests.

Table

 evaluates the proposed method on regression tasks under three settings of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

(0.01,
 0.02,
 0.05),
 reporting absolute errors per dataset.
 A key characteristic of these results is the pronounced scale heterogeneity:
 several datasets yield very small errors (on the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-1}$
\end_inset

),
 whereas a small number of datasets produce much larger values (most notably BASEBALL and HOUSING).
 Consequently,
 the mean is strongly influenced by a few large-error cases,
 while the median better reflects the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

typical” dataset behavior.
 Under the mean criterion,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02 provides the best overall outcome (average error ≈ 5.27),
 followed closely by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01 (≈ 5.33),
 where as
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 is higher (≈ 5.40).
 This ordering is consistent with the medians as well (0.050 for
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02,
 0.057 for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01,
 0.060 for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05),
 indicating that the 0.02 setting tends to reduce central errors slightly,
 without causing a major shift in the overall distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the dataset level,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02 emerges as the most consistently favorable choice.
 It achieves the lowest error with a strict advantage on 11 datasets and,
 when ties are included,
 it matches the best value on 17 out of 21 datasets.
 The clearest gains for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02 occur on datasets that also affect the mean,
 such as AUTO (11.55 vs 12.07/11.87),
 BL (0.006 vs 0.032/0.010),
 BASEBALL (57.83 vs 58.86/60.52),
 MORTGAGE (0.079 vs 0.12/0.085),
 QUAKE (0.007 vs 0.04/0.011),
 and STOCK (3.93 vs 4.30/4.51).
 In contrast,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05provides a clear advantage only on a limited subset,
 primarily BK (0.019),
 HOUSING (26.53),
 and TREASURY (0.17),
 while 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01 is strictly best only on PLASTIC (2.21).
 Additionally,
 several datasets are effectively insensitive to 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

 (AIRFOIL,
 CONCRETE,
 HO,
 PL),
 where all settings yield identical outcomes.
 Overall,
 for regression performance as summarized in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expRegressionPc"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02 is the most reliable default setting in terms of both average error and frequency of best results,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 being preferable in specific datasets and
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01 offering isolated advantages.

 shows no statistically significant differences among pc settings on the regression datasets.

 The pairwise comparisons likewise provide no evidence of separation.
 Therefore,
 the tested

Experiments with the weight parameter

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
In order to determine the stability of the proposed method under different initialization conditions,
 another experiment was conducted using it in which various values for the initialization parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 were tested.
 The experimental results for the classification datasets are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expClassIw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 and for regression datasets in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expRegressionIw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expClassIw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 examines the sensitivity of the proposed classifier to the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 using three settings (1,
 10,
 20) across 34 classification datasets,
 where lower error rates indicate better performance.
 The aggregate trend is monotonic and unfavorable as 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 increases:
 the average error rises from 19.45% at 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 to 20.57% at 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 and 21.15% at 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20.
 In practical terms,
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 yields an absolute advantage of 1.12 percentage points over 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 and 1.70 points over 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20,
 corresponding to approximately 5.5% and 8.0% relative error reductions,
 respectively.
 The same pattern is reflected in the distribution’s center,
 with medians of about 17.17% (
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1),
 17.75% (
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10),
 and 18.49% (
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20).
 Meanwhile,
 the spread across datasets remains comparable (standard deviation close to 14% for all three settings),
 suggesting that the degradation with higher 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 is not driven by a small number of extreme cases but by a consistent upward shift in errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A dataset-wise view further supports this conclusion.
 The setting 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 achieves the lowest error on 22 of the 34 datasets,
 whereas 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20 each win on 6 datasets,
 with no ties for best.
 Importantly,
 larger 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{(w)}$
\end_inset

values are not uniformly detrimental:
 there are clear instances where 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20 improves performance,
 such as CLEVELAND (43.20%),
 CIRCULAR (5.14%),
 PIMA (26.46%),
 and SPIRAL (43.86%).
 However,
 these gains are offset by pronounced losses on other datasets,
 including DERMATOLOGY where 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 is markedly superior (6.03% vs 13.97-14.83),
 SEGMENT (33.09% vs 38.85-47.02),
 and WINE (6.82% vs 8.12-12.00).
 Overall,
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expClassIw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 indicates that 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 is the most reliable default for classification,
 while higher settings behave more like specialized adjustments that can benefit particular datasets but tend to reduce average performance across the benchmark suite.

\end_inset

 suggests that the Iw parameter has a marginal yet detectable effect on the classification datasets,
 as the overall Friedman test yields p=0.0423 and slightly rejects the null of equivalent settings at the 0.05 level.
 However,
 the pairwise comparisons do not support strong separation:
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 gives p=0.2834 (not significant) and
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20 gives p=0.069 (also not significant,
 but close to 0.05).
 This indicates that differences are modest and distributed across settings rather than producing a clear,
 strongly significant pairwise contrast.
 Practically,
 Iw behaves as a secondary tuning parameter with limited impact,
 where an overall difference is detectable but not pronounced in simple post-hoc tests.
 Hence,
 selecting 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 can be guided by mean performance or stability,
 acknowledging that the statistical effects are weak.

 reports a regression sensitivity analysis of the proposed method with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

(1,
 10,
 20) using absolute error values.
 At the aggregate level,
 differences are modest:
 the average error is 6.10 for 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1,
 5.33 for
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10,
 and 5.46 for 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20.
 Thus,
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 is the best overall setting,
 improving the mean by 0.77 relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1(≈12.6% reduction) and by 0.13 relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20(≈2.4%).
 Given the heterogeneous error scales across datasets,
 these mean differences are influenced by a small number of high-magnitude cases,
 so it is also informative to consider the per-dataset pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the dataset level,
 no single setting dominates uniformly,
 rather,
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 behaves as a tuning parameter.
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 attains the minimum error on 8 out of 21 datasets and is close to the best on several others,
 while 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20 is best on 7 datasets and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 on 6 datasets.
 The most visible gains favoring 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 occur on AUTO (12.07 vs 16.88),
 BASEBALL (58.86 vs 67.47),
 and TREASURY (0.20 vs 1.98),
 whereas 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20 is clearly preferable on ABALONE (4.22),
 AIRFOIL (0.001),
 FRIEDMAN (2.07),
 MORTGAGE (0.088),
 and STOCK (4.13).
 Conversely,
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 is best on BK (0.021),
 BL (0.003),
 FY (0.041),
 HO (0.008),
 HOUSING (23.12),
 LASER (0.005),
 and LW (0.012).
 Overall,
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expRegressionIw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 suggests 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 as a reasonable default for regression under the mean criterion,
 while the optimal choice can vary by dataset without producing large shifts in the overall performance picture.

 indicates that varying the Iw parameter does not produce statistically significant differences on the regression datasets.
 The overall Friedman test reports p=0.3050,
 therefore the null hypothesis of equivalent settings is not rejected under the standard 0.05 threshold.
 The pairwise comparisons are clearly non-significant as well,
 with p=0.9856 for 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$

\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20.
 Such large p-values imply practically indistinguishable behavior among the examined settings,
 with no evidence of a consistent winner.
 Hence,
 for regression,
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 can be selected based on secondary considerations because its statistical impact appears negligible.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposed training procedure improves generalization by introducing,
 prior to the main optimization,
 an additional stage that identifies an appropriate range of values for the network weights.
 This stage is based on a Simulated Annealing variant that adjusts the admissible weight bounds in order to reduce the likelihood of getting trapped in local minima and to limit overfitting.
 The final training is then performed inside these bounds using a genetic optimization stage followed by a local BFGS refinement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the classification experiments,
 the proposed machine-learning model achieves the best mean performance,
 with an average classification error of 20.57,
 and with clear separation from all competing approaches.
 The advantage is not confined to isolated datasets,
 but emerges as a consistent pattern across a large portion of the benchmark suite,
 while also being accompanied by reduced dispersion of errors,
 which is compatible with more stable behavior on heterogeneous classification tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The statistical analysis supports these observations.
 For classification,
 the overall Friedman test reports p=
\begin_inset Formula $2.89×10^{-11}$
\end_inset

,
 thus very strongly rejecting the hypothesis of equivalent performance across methods.
 The post-hoc comparisons indicate statistically significant differences in favor of the proposed machine-learning model against all main baselines,
 with particularly strong evidence against ADAM,
 BFGS,
 and PRUNE,
 and highly significant differences against GENETIC and RBF.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the regression experiments,
 the proposed machine-learning model attains the lowest mean absolute error,
 equal to 5.33,
 and the overall Friedman test remains significant with p=
\begin_inset Formula $1.55×10^{-4}$
\end_inset

,
 indicating that genuine performance differences exist.
 However,
 the pairwise picture is more nuanced.
 The strongest statistical separation is observed primarily against BFGS with p=
\begin_inset Formula $3.35×10^{-4}$
\end_inset

,
 and a weaker but still significant difference is observed against GENETIC with p=0.0113,
 whereas differences against ADAM,
 RBF,
 and PRUNE are not supported at the 0.05 level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sensitivity studies suggest that variations of the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

 parameter do not yield measurable statistical differences,
 both for classification and regression,
 indicating that this setting is not critical within the tested range.
 In contrast,
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 parameter in classification exhibits a marginal overall effect,
 with an overall p=0.0423,
 but without clear confirmation through simple pairwise comparisons.
 For regression,
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 shows no statistically detectable impact,
 with an overall p=0.3050 and non-significant pairwise tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several directions follow naturally for future work.
 First,
 the generality of adaptive weight bounds should be assessed under alternative final optimizers and across a broader set of architectures,
 including deeper networks and different activation functions.
 Second,
 the fitness definition used during the Simulated Annealing phase should be redesigned to incorporate explicit generalization criteria,
 such as validation error or robustness to noise,
 so that the bound-selection stage more directly targets out-of-sample performance.
 Third,
 the cost-benefit trade-off should be quantified systematically,
 and CPU or GPU parallelization should be explored,
 since the Simulated Annealing phase requires repeated evaluations and may dominate the overall runtime.
