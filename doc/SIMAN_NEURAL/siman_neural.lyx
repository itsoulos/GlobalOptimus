\begin_layout Abstract
Artificial neural networks are reliable machine learning models that have been applied to a multitude of practical and scientific applications in recent decades.
 Among these applications there are examples from the areas of physics,
 chemistry,
 medicine,
 etc.
 For their effective application to these problems,
 it is necessary to adapt their parameters using optimization techniques.
 However,
 in order to be effective,
 optimization techniques must know the range of values for the parameters of the artificial neural network,
 so that they can adequately train the artificial neural network.
 In most cases,
 this is not possible,
 as these ranges are also significantly affected by the inputs to the artificial neural network from the objective problem it is called upon to solve.
 This situation usually results in artificial neural networks becoming trapped in local minima of the error function or,
 even worse,
 in the phenomenon of overfitting,
 where although the training error achieves low values,
 the artificial neural network exhibits low performance in the corresponding test set.
 To address this limitation,
 this work proposes a novel two-stage training approach in which a simulated annealing (SA)–based preprocessing stage is employed to automatically identify optimal parameter value intervals before the application of any optimization method to train the neural network.
 Unlike similar approaches that rely on fixed or heuristically selected parameter bounds,
 the proposed pre-processing technique explores the parameter space probabilistically,
 guided by a temperature-controlled acceptance mechanism that balances global exploration and local refinement.
 The proposed method has been successfully applied to a wide range of classification and regression problems and comparative results are presented in detail in the present work.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Artificial neural networks are among the most commonly used machine learning models for solving classification and regression tasks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nn1,nn2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 These models are typically formulated as functions 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 where the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}$
\end_inset

 represents the input pattern and 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{w}$
\end_inset

 denotes the set of trainable parameters of the neural network.
 Model training is achieved by minimizing the training error,
 which is defined by the following expression:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mbox{E}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{M}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x}_{i},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},y_{i}\right),\ i=1,...,M$
\end_inset

 stands for the associated training set of the objective problem.
 In this set each value 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the desired output for the pattern 
\begin_inset Formula $\overrightarrow{x_{i}}$
\end_inset

.
 As suggested in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "nnc"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 a neural network could be expressed as a function with the following definition:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{H}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)}\sigma\left(\sum_{j=1}^{d}x_{j}w_{(d+2)i-(d+1)+j}+w_{(d+2)i}\right)\label{eq:nn}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this equation,
 the value 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

 represents the number of desired processing units.
 Also,
 the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(x)$
\end_inset

 stands for the the sigmoid function,
 expressed as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sigma(x)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x)}\label{eq:sig}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

The total number of parameters for neural network can be calculated as 
\begin_inset Formula $n=(d+2)H$
\end_inset

,
 using the equation

Moreover,
 a series of alternative activation functions has been proposed in the related literature,

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\mbox{tanh}\left(x\right)=\frac{e^{2x}+1}{e^{2x}-1}\label{eq:tanh}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Additionally,
 Guarnieri et al proposed the incorporation of an adaptive spline function as the activation function

 In overfitting,
 the neural network demonstrates degraded performance when applied to data that were not present during the training phase.
 The overfitting issue has been studied by various researches during the past years and a variety of algorithms have been proposed for this problem,

The current work introduces a new method,
 that is based on the Simulated Annealing approach to identify the optimal range of values for the parameters of the neural network before the incorporation of the training method.
 The first phase method creates various test value intervals which it adjusts appropriately through the usage of an innovative technique based on Simulated Annealing.
 This method starts from an initial range of values \SpecialChar allowbreak
\SpecialChar allowbreak
which can be expanded or contracted in an attempt to avoid the phenomenon of overfitting.
 After the end of the first phase,
 the artificial neural network is trained within the optimal value interval identified in the first phase using any optimization technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Determining appropriate initial parameter constraints is a major issue in neural network training because the choice of initial values strongly influences optimization dynamics,
 convergence speed,
 and final model performance.
 Poor initialization—
such as weights that are too large or too small—
can lead to numerical and optimization issues like vanishing or exploding gradients,
 which hinder effective gradient-based learning,
 especially in deep architectures.
 As a result,
 training may become unstable,
 excessively slow,
 or fail altogether.
 There is no method that adaptively optimizes weight constraints based on specific data characteristics before the main training.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several initialization methods from the related literature,
 such as sampling weights from a standard normal or uniform distribution without accounting the size of the neural networks,
 can lead to vanishing or exploding gradients,
 particularly in deep architectures,
 severely impairing convergence 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Similarly,
 the Xavier initialization method defines the variance of the initial weights based on the number of input and output units 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "glorotInit"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 While effective for sigmoid and tanh activations,
 this approach has been shown to perform poorly with rectified linear units.
 In the same direction of research,
 He initialization extends the previous method by adapting the variance scaling,
 improving training stability under specific assumptions regarding activation sparsity 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 However,
 its effectiveness remains dependent on the network architecture and activation behavior,
 and inappropriate parameter constraints can still degrade optimization.

 The behavior of this algorithm is controlled by a positive parameter that resembles the annealing temperature in physics.
 At high temperatures the algorithm performs a wider search in the value range of the objective problem and as the temperature decreases the algorithm focuses on some possible minima of the objective function.
 Temperature reduction can be achieved by different cooling mechanisms,
 as reported in the relevant literature

The proposed modification constructs candidate intervals for the neural network parameters and assesses each interval by generating multiple random parameter configurations within it.
 The mean error of the resulting neural networks is then used as the performance measure for the corresponding interval.

\begin_inset Formula $B\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right),a\right)$

 To calculate this quantity,
 it is assumed that the sigmoid function with the following definition is used as the activation function of the artificial neural network:

As can be observed from both the analytical expression and the corresponding figure,
 the function exhibits rapid saturation,
 asymptotically approaching 1 for large positive values of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and converging to 0 for large negative values.
 This saturation behavior significantly limits the function’s generalization capacity,
 since substantial variations in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 result in only marginal changes in the output of the sigmoid function.
 The quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right),a\right)$
\end_inset

 was introduced in that paper can be used to measure this effect.

.
 The resulting function can be employed as a regularization mechanism to mitigate overfitting by constraining the neural network parameters within problem-dependent intervals.
 The user-defined parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 serves as an upper bound on the input of the sigmoid unit.
 When this bound is exceeded,
 the network is likely to exhibit diminished generalization performance,
 as the sigmoid function enters a saturation regime in which variations in the input no longer produce meaningful changes in the output.

\begin_layout Standard
As can be observed from both the equation of the sigmoid equation and the corresponding figure,
 when the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 increases,
 the function rapidly approaches the value 1.
 Conversely,
 as 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 decreases,
 the function takes values that are very close to 0.
 This behavior indicates that the function quickly loses its generalization capability,
 since significant variations in the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 no longer lead to proportional changes in the output of the sigmoid function.
 For this reason,
 the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{calculateB}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right),a\right)$
\end_inset

 was used to quantify this effect.
 It can be employed to prevent overfitting by constraining the neural network parameters within intervals that depend on the specific problem at hand.
 The user-defined parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

serves as an upper bound for the input of the sigmoid unit.
 When this bound is exceeded,
 the neural network is likely to exhibit reduced generalization ability,
 as the sigmoid output remains nearly constant regardless of further changes in the input.

 The behavior of the proposed method is controlled by a variable representing the temperature.
 At high temperatures the method searches a wider range of the problem and may generate value ranges for the neural network parameters that will have a large range.
 However,
 as the temperature drops,
 the method focuses on value ranges that are more promising.

After finding a promising range of values \SpecialChar allowbreak

 the optimization of these parameters within this range is performed.
 This optimization minimizes the error function and any optimization method could be used.
 In this work,
 the Genetic Algorithm method was chosen to be used.
 The Genetic Algorithm method was preferred over other local optimization techniques,
 such as the Adam method,
 because it is a global optimization method and aims to find the global minimum of an objective function with a greater guarantee for finding the optimal set of values \SpecialChar allowbreak
\SpecialChar allowbreak
for the weights of the artificial neural network.
 Furthermore,
 it has been used effectively in the past for training artificial neural networks.

Experimental results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental software was implemented in C++ using the freely available Optimus framework 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "optimus"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 Each experimental configuration was executed 30 independent times,
 with a distinct random seed assigned to each run.
 To ensure a reliable evaluation of the results,
 the ten-fold cross-validation methodology was employed.
 All experiments were repeated 30 times,
 and performance was quantified using the mean classification error for the classification datasets and the mean regression error for the regression datasets.
 The classification error is calculated using the following equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{C}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=100\times\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\left(\mbox{class}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)-y_{i}\right)}{K}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here the set 
\begin_inset Formula $T=\left\{ x_{i},y_{i}\right\} ,\ i=1,\ldots,K$
\end_inset

 represents the associated test set of the objective problem.
 Similarly,
 the regression error for the test set is given from the following equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
E_{R}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x},\overrightarrow{w}\right)\right)=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}\left(N\left(\overrightarrow{x_{i}},\overrightarrow{w}\right)-y_{i}\right)^{2}}{K}
\end{equation}

 reports classification error rates (lower is better) across 34 datasets for seven learning/training approaches,
 with the last row providing the average error per method.
 At the aggregate level,
 the proposed approach (PROPOSED) is clearly the best performer,
 achieving an average error of 20.57%,
 while the second-best average is obtained by GENETIC at 26.55%.
 This corresponds to an absolute improvement of 5.97 percentage points,
 i.e.,
 an approximately 22.5% relative error reduction compared to GENETIC.
 The advantage remains consistent against the remaining baselines:
 relative to PRUNE (27.44%) the improvement is 6.87 points (~25.0% relative reduction),
 relative to RBF (29.42%) it is 8.85 points (~30.1%),
 relative to NEAT (32.11%) it is 11.54 points (~35.9%),
 and relative to ADAM/BFGS (34.48%/34.34%) it is about 13.9 points (~40% relative reduction).
 In addition,
 when considering variability across heterogeneous datasets,
 PROPOSED exhibits the lowest dispersion of errors (standard deviation ≈ 14.31),
 which is consistent with more stable behavior across different classification tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a per-dataset perspective (minimum error per row),
 PROPOSED attains the best result on 23 out of 34 datasets (≈67.6%),
 indicating that its superiority is systematic rather than driven by a small subset of cases.
 Moreover,
 PROPOSED ranks within the top two methods on 31/34 datasets and within the top three on 33/34 datasets,
 highlighting strong rank consistency.
 In the datasets where PROPOSED is not the best,
 it is often very close to the winner (e.g.,
 SPIRAL:
 44.90% vs 44.87%,
 ALCOHOL:
 15.99% vs 15.75%,
 POPFAILURES:
 5.06% vs 4.79%),
 with a limited number of more pronounced gaps such as ECOLI (49.67% vs 43.44%) and DERMATOLOGY (14.83% vs 9.02%).
 Conversely,
 there are datasets where PROPOSED achieves large margins over the second-best method,
 notably SEGMENT (38.85% vs 49.75%),
 HEARTATTACK (18.97% vs 29.00%),
 HEART (18.37% vs 27.21%),
 and WINE (8.12% vs 16.62%).
 Overall,
 Table 2 supports that the proposed method delivers the best mean performance,
 the best average ranking,
 and the highest number of dataset-level wins,
 with only sporadic cases where alternative methods outperform it.

 were obtained via R-based analyses on the classification experiment tables,
 aiming to verify that the observed performance differences are statistically reliable rather than due to random variation.
 The overall Friedman test yields p=
\begin_inset Formula $2.89×10^{-11}$
\end_inset

,
 which is extremely small and therefore strongly rejects the null hypothesis that all methods perform equivalently.
 This indicates that,
 across the set of datasets,
 genuine performance differences exist among the considered models and motivates post-hoc pairwise comparisons against the proposed approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pairwise results confirm that the proposed method differs significantly from each baseline.
 In particular,
 the comparisons ADAM vs PROPOSED and BFGS vs PROPOSED produce p=
\begin_inset Formula $1.78×10^{-8}$
\end_inset

 and p=
\begin_inset Formula $5.17×10^{-9}$
\end_inset

,
 respectively,
 providing very strong evidence of a difference (well beyond the p<0.0001 threshold).
 The PRUNE vs PROPOSED comparison is also highly decisive (p=
\begin_inset Formula $2.07×10^{-5}$
\end_inset

,
 i.e.,
 p<0.0001).
 For GENETIC and RBF,
 the p-values are larger but remain below 0.01 (p=0.0076 and p=0.0085),
 which corresponds to a “highly significant” difference.
 Overall,
 Figure

 but is also substantiated by strong statistical significance against all competing baselines.

\end_inset

,
 the computed parameter intervals of the neural network are reported as left and right bounds (L and R) obtained by the Simulated Annealing bound-optimization stage,
 for three datasets with different dimensionality (WINE:
 150 parameters,
 WDBC:
 320,
 DERMATOLOGY:
 360).
 The visualization highlights that the bounds do not change uniformly;
 instead,
 they vary substantially across parameters and across datasets,
 indicating that the proposed stage does not enforce a fixed range but identifies problem-dependent search regions.
 Most intervals cross zero and remain centered close to 0,
 while their widths can become very large and exhibit occasional extreme expansions,
 particularly for DERMATOLOGY where a subset of parameters attains markedly wider intervals.
 As shown in Figure [bounds_sa.png],
 this variability supports the claim that the resulting bounds adapt to each dataset’s structure and scale,
 thereby providing a tailored search space for the subsequent training phase.

In the regression part of Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expRegression"

\end_inset

,
 errors are reported in absolute units and span a very wide dynamic range (from approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 up to hundreds),
 meaning that a few large-error cases can dominate average performance.
 Under this regime,
 the proposed approach (PROPOSED) delivers the most favorable aggregate outcome,
 with the lowest mean error of 5.33,
 compared to 9.31 for GENETIC and 10.02 for RBF.
 The reduction from 9.31 to 5.33 corresponds to a 3.98-unit absolute gain,
 i.e.,
 about a 42.8% relative improvement over the best competing average (GENETIC).
 Importantly,
 PROPOSED also exhibits the strongest robustness against extreme values,
 showing the smallest variability across datasets (standard deviation ≈ 13.75).
 This point matters in regression benchmarking because heavy-tailed errors can materially affect the mean and may reveal instability.
 In contrast,
 ADAM and BFGS show very large worst-case outcomes (e.g.,
 180.89 and 302.43 on STOCK),
 which inflates their averages (22.46 and 30.29,
 respectively) and indicates sensitivity to high-scale or difficult regression settings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at dataset-level outcomes (row-wise minima),
 PROPOSED attains the best result or ties for best on 14 out of 21 regression datasets,
 including 11 outright wins and 3 top ties.
 Beyond wins,
 its rank consistency is strong:
 PROPOSED falls within the top two methods on 18/21 datasets and within the top three on 20/21 datasets,
 suggesting that its advantage is not driven by a small number of isolated successes.
 Several datasets show substantive margins rather than marginal differences,
 including HOUSING (26.76 vs 43.26 for the runner-up),
 TREASURY (0.20 vs 2.02),
 MORTGAGE (0.12 vs 1.45),
 and BASEBALL (58.86 vs 77.90).
 The few cases where PROPOSED is not the best do not overturn the overall pattern:
 on ABALONE it is essentially tied with the best value (4.31 vs 4.30),
 BL is dominated by RBF (0.013),
 and FY is the only dataset where PROPOSED falls outside the top three,
 yet the absolute gap remains small (0.057 vs 0.038).
 Overall,
 Table 2 indicates that the proposed method achieves the strongest balance of low mean error,
 frequent top performance,
 and reduced exposure to severe outliers,
 which is particularly relevant for regression evaluation across heterogeneous datasets.

 reports statistical significance levels for the regression experiments,
 based on p-values computed through R scripts.
 The overall Friedman test yields p=
\begin_inset Formula $1.55×10^{-4}$
\end_inset

,
 which is well below 0.001,
 indicating that the compared methods do not behave equivalently across the regression datasets and that genuine performance differences exist.
 This justifies examining post-hoc pairwise comparisons against the proposed method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pairwise outcomes reveal a more mixed pattern than in the classification case,
 which is expected in regression settings where absolute-error scales can vary substantially across datasets.
 The strongest evidence of a difference in favor of the proposed approach is observed against BFGS (
\begin_inset Formula $p=3.35×10^{-4}$
\end_inset

),
 which falls in the extremely significant range (
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.001$
\end_inset

).
 The comparison with GENETIC yields 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.0113$
\end_inset

,
 i.e.,
 significant at the 0.05 level but not highly significant,
 implying a reliable yet weaker separation.
 In contrast,
 ADAM,
 RBF,
 and PRUNE produce p-values of 0.0585,
 0.1462,
 and 0.0898,
 respectively,
 all above 0.05,
 meaning that differences versus the proposed method are not statistically supported under the standard threshold.
 Overall,
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:stat_regre_methods"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 suggests that,
 for regression,
 the proposed method exhibits statistically substantiated advantages primarily over BFGS and,
 to a lesser extent,
 over GENETIC,
 while differences relative to the remaining baselines are not strong enough to rule out random experimental variability.

The Figure

\end_inset

 reports mean runtime as a function of the neural network’s number of nodes,
 comparing the Genetic Algorithm against the proposed method.
 Both runtimes increase with network size,
 but the proposed method consistently exhibits a much higher computational cost.
 Specifically,
 for 2 nodes the Genetic Algorithm requires 11.34 on average versus 213.21 for the proposed method;
 for 5 nodes the corresponding values are 29.18 versus 420.43,
 and for 10 nodes they are 57.95 versus 790.35.
 The gap remains large in all cases,
 and the relative overhead decreases only slightly as network size grows,
 without changing the overall conclusion.
 Overall,
 the results document a clear trade-off:
 the proposed method is substantially more time- consuming,
 and its use is therefore justified when improvements in accuracy or generalization outweigh the additional computational burden.

\end_inset

 provides a targeted sensitivity study of the proposed classifier with respect to the crossover-related parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

,
 reporting error rates (lower is better) on 34 classification datasets for three settings (
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01,
 0.02,
 0.05).
 The averages at the bottom of the table are extremely close,
 yet they consistently favor 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05:
 20.33% versus 20.54% for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02 and 20.57% for
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01.
 The absolute gain relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}=0.01$
\end_inset

 is only 0.24 percentage points (approximately a 1.2% relative reduction),
 which suggests that the method’s performance is not highly sensitive to moderate changes in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

.
 This limited sensitivity is also reflected by the central tendency and spread:
 the medians are nearly identical (about 17.75%,
 17.85%,
 and 17.90%),
 and the dispersion across datasets remains comparable for all three settings (standard deviation around 14%),
 indicating that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

 mainly shifts performance on particular datasets rather than reshaping the overall distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more informative view emerges from the dataset-wise minima.
 The setting 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 achieves the lowest error on 13 out of 34 datasets and ties for best on one additional dataset (STUDENT),
 i.e.,
 14/34 top outcomes.
 In comparison,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01 is best on 11 datasets,
 while 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02 is best on 9 datasets plus one top tie.
 Hence,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 is the strongest default choice in terms of both average performance and frequency of best results,
 but the table also highlights clear dataset-specific preferences.
 For instance,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 yields notable improvements on LIVERDISORDER (33.71% to 30.26%),
 APPENDICITIS (15.50% to 12.40%),
 DERMATOLOGY (14.83% to 11.92%),
 AUSTRALIAN (27.22% to 24.58%),
 and ECOLI (49.67% to 47.15%).
 Conversely,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01 is distinctly advantageous on SEGMENT (38.85% vs 44.21-44.72),
 SPIRAL (44.90% vs 45.29-47.77),
 and WINE (8.12% vs 10.65-11.23).
 Overall,
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expClassPC"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 indicates that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

 acts as a fine-grained control parameter:
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 optimizes mean behavior and the count of best-case outcomes,
 while smaller values such as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01 can be preferable for specific datasets.

 hence the null hypothesis of equivalent settings is not rejected.
 Moreover,
 the pairwise comparisons 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 both give p=1,
 confirming no evidence of separation.
 Therefore,
 within the tested range,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

 behaves as a practically neutral tuning choice,
 and the selection can be guided by secondary considerations (e.g.,
 stability or computational cost).
 In summary,
 the three pc settings are statistically indistinguishable for classification under the reported tests.

 evaluates the proposed method on regression tasks under three settings of the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

(0.01,
 0.02,
 0.05),
 reporting absolute errors per dataset.
 A key characteristic of these results is the pronounced scale heterogeneity:
 several datasets yield very small errors (on the order of 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-3}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{-1}$
\end_inset

),
 whereas a small number of datasets produce much larger values (most notably BASEBALL and HOUSING).
 Consequently,
 the mean is strongly influenced by a few large-error cases,
 while the median better reflects the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

typical” dataset behavior.
 Under the mean criterion,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02 provides the best overall outcome (average error ≈ 5.27),
 followed closely by 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01 (≈ 5.33),
 where as
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 is higher (≈ 5.40).
 This ordering is consistent with the medians as well (0.050 for
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02,
 0.057 for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01,
 0.060 for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05),
 indicating that the 0.02 setting tends to reduce central errors slightly,
 without causing a major shift in the overall distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the dataset level,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02 emerges as the most consistently favorable choice.
 It achieves the lowest error with a strict advantage on 11 datasets and,
 when ties are included,
 it matches the best value on 17 out of 21 datasets.
 The clearest gains for 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02 occur on datasets that also affect the mean,
 such as AUTO (11.55 vs 12.07/11.87),
 BL (0.006 vs 0.032/0.010),
 BASEBALL (57.83 vs 58.86/60.52),
 MORTGAGE (0.079 vs 0.12/0.085),
 QUAKE (0.007 vs 0.04/0.011),
 and STOCK (3.93 vs 4.30/4.51).
 In contrast,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05provides a clear advantage only on a limited subset,
 primarily BK (0.019),
 HOUSING (26.53),
 and TREASURY (0.17),
 while 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01 is strictly best only on PLASTIC (2.21).
 Additionally,
 several datasets are effectively insensitive to 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

 (AIRFOIL,
 CONCRETE,
 HO,
 PL),
 where all settings yield identical outcomes.
 Overall,
 for regression performance as summarized in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expRegressionPc"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.02 is the most reliable default setting in terms of both average error and frequency of best results,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.05 being preferable in specific datasets and
\begin_inset Formula $p_{c}$
\end_inset

=0.01 offering isolated advantages.

 shows no statistically significant differences among pc settings on the regression datasets.
 The Friedman test yields p=0.092 (>0.05),
 so equivalence is not rejected.
 The pairwise comparisons likewise provide no evidence of separation.
 Therefore,
 the tested

Experiments with the weight parameter

\begin_layout Standard
In order to determine the stability of the proposed method under different initialization conditions,
 another experiment was conducted using it in which various values for the initialization parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 were tested.
 The experimental results for the classification datasets are shown in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expClassIw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 and for regression datasets in Table

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 examines the sensitivity of the proposed classifier to the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 using three settings (1,
 10,
 20) across 34 classification datasets,
 where lower error rates indicate better performance.
 The aggregate trend is monotonic and unfavorable as 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 increases:
 the average error rises from 19.45% at 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 to 20.57% at 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 and 21.15% at 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20.
 In practical terms,
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 yields an absolute advantage of 1.12 percentage points over 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 and 1.70 points over 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20,
 corresponding to approximately 5.5% and 8.0% relative error reductions,
 respectively.
 The same pattern is reflected in the distribution’s center,
 with medians of about 17.17% (
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1),
 17.75% (
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10),
 and 18.49% (
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20).
 Meanwhile,
 the spread across datasets remains comparable (standard deviation close to 14% for all three settings),
 suggesting that the degradation with higher 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 is not driven by a small number of extreme cases but by a consistent upward shift in errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A dataset-wise view further supports this conclusion.
 The setting 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 achieves the lowest error on 22 of the 34 datasets,
 whereas 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20 each win on 6 datasets,
 with no ties for best.
 Importantly,
 larger 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{(w)}$
\end_inset

values are not uniformly detrimental:
 there are clear instances where 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20 improves performance,
 such as CLEVELAND (43.20%),
 CIRCULAR (5.14%),
 PIMA (26.46%),
 and SPIRAL (43.86%).
 However,
 these gains are offset by pronounced losses on other datasets,
 including DERMATOLOGY where 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 is markedly superior (6.03% vs 13.97-14.83),
 SEGMENT (33.09% vs 38.85-47.02),
 and WINE (6.82% vs 8.12-12.00).
 Overall,
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expClassIw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 indicates that 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 is the most reliable default for classification,
 while higher settings behave more like specialized adjustments that can benefit particular datasets but tend to reduce average performance across the benchmark suite.

\end_inset

 suggests that the Iw parameter has a marginal yet detectable effect on the classification datasets,
 as the overall Friedman test yields p=0.0423 and slightly rejects the null of equivalent settings at the 0.05 level.
 However,
 the pairwise comparisons do not support strong separation:
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 gives p=0.2834 (not significant) and
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20 gives p=0.069 (also not significant,
 but close to 0.05).
 This indicates that differences are modest and distributed across settings rather than producing a clear,
 strongly significant pairwise contrast.
 Practically,
 Iw behaves as a secondary tuning parameter with limited impact,
 where an overall difference is detectable but not pronounced in simple post-hoc tests.
 Hence,
 selecting 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 can be guided by mean performance or stability,
 acknowledging that the statistical effects are weak.

 reports a regression sensitivity analysis of the proposed method with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

(1,
 10,
 20) using absolute error values.
 At the aggregate level,
 differences are modest:
 the average error is 6.10 for 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1,
 5.33 for
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10,
 and 5.46 for 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20.
 Thus,
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 is the best overall setting,
 improving the mean by 0.77 relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1(≈12.6% reduction) and by 0.13 relative to 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20(≈2.4%).
 Given the heterogeneous error scales across datasets,
 these mean differences are influenced by a small number of high-magnitude cases,
 so it is also informative to consider the per-dataset pattern.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the dataset level,
 no single setting dominates uniformly,
 rather,
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 behaves as a tuning parameter.
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 attains the minimum error on 8 out of 21 datasets and is close to the best on several others,
 while 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20 is best on 7 datasets and 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 on 6 datasets.
 The most visible gains favoring 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 occur on AUTO (12.07 vs 16.88),
 BASEBALL (58.86 vs 67.47),
 and TREASURY (0.20 vs 1.98),
 whereas 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20 is clearly preferable on ABALONE (4.22),
 AIRFOIL (0.001),
 FRIEDMAN (2.07),
 MORTGAGE (0.088),
 and STOCK (4.13).
 Conversely,
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 is best on BK (0.021),
 BL (0.003),
 FY (0.041),
 HO (0.008),
 HOUSING (23.12),
 LASER (0.005),
 and LW (0.012).
 Overall,
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expRegressionIw"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

 suggests 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 as a reasonable default for regression under the mean criterion,
 while the optimal choice can vary by dataset without producing large shifts in the overall performance picture.

 indicates that varying the 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

parameter does not produce statistically significant differences on the regression datasets.
 The overall Friedman test reports 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.3050$
\end_inset

,
 therefore the null hypothesis of equivalent settings is not rejected under the standard 0.05 threshold.
 The pairwise comparisons are clearly non-significant as well,
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.9856$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=10 vs

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=1 vs 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

=20.
 Such large p-values imply practically indistinguishable behavior among the examined settings,
 with no evidence of a consistent winner.
 Hence,
 for regression,
 
\begin_inset Formula $I_{w}$
\end_inset

 can be selected based on secondary considerations because its statistical impact appears negligible.

Experiments with initialization methods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally,
 three method from the related literature were used as the initialization methods for the weights of the neural network:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Xavier method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "initXavier"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 which sets the variance of the weights based on both the number of input and output connections in the hidden layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The HE method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "initXE"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 which scales the weight variance according to the number of input connections
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The LeCun method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "initLECUN"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 that sets the weight variance inversely proportional to the number of input connections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These weight initialization techniques were used by a genetic algorithm to train the artificial neural network and the results for the classification datasets are outlined in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:expClassInit"

 and for the regression datasets in Table

isolates the role of the initialization distribution within a genetic-training setting and compares it directly against the proposed machine-learning model on the same set of classification datasets,
 using error rate as the performance measure.
 In terms of averages,
 the four genetic variants differ in a noticeable yet bounded manner,
 ranging from 26.55% for the uniform initialization down to 24.69% for the LeCun initialization,
 a spread of about 1.86 percentage points.
 This indicates that initialization matters,
 but it does not,
 by itself,
 reshape the overall performance profile.
 The proposed machine-learning model attains a substantially lower mean error of 20.57%,
 which is about 4.12 percentage points below even the strongest genetic initialization (LeCun),
 corresponding to roughly a 16.7% relative reduction in mean error.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dataset-level pattern confirms that this advantage is not merely an artifact of aggregation.
 The proposed machine-learning model achieves the lowest error on 26 out of 34 datasets,
 showing consistent superiority over all genetic initialization choices across most of the benchmark suite.
 The limited cases where a genetic initialization is better occur on BALANCE,
 CIRCULAR,
 DERMATOLOGY,
 GLASS,
 HABERMAN,
 LIVERDISORDER,
 MAMMOGRAPHIC,
 and REGIONS2.
 Even among these,
 some gaps are marginal,
 while others are more pronounced,
 suggesting that dataset structure can selectively favor specific initialization schemes.
 At the same time,
 on several challenging datasets the proposed machine-learning model yields clear reductions relative to every genetic variant,
 including APPENDICITIS,
 ALCOHOL,
 HEART,
 HEARTATTACK,
 SEGMENT,
 WDBC,
 WINE,
 and ZO_NF_S.
 Overall,
 Table 8 supports that initialization choice within the genetic framework has a measurable but secondary effect,
 whereas the proposed machine-learning model delivers a consistently stronger outcome both in average error and in the frequency of best per-dataset results.

 reports regression results in absolute error units and compares four genetic-training variants that differ only in the initialization distribution against the proposed machine-learning model.
 The data indicate that initialization within the genetic framework has a tangible impact on aggregate performance,
 as the genetic mean error changes from 9.31 with UNIFORM to 7.24 with XAVIER and 7.32 with LECUN.
 Nevertheless,
 the proposed machine-learning model achieves the lowest mean error,
 5.33,
 which is 1.91 units below the best genetic mean,
 corresponding to an approximately 26% relative reduction.
 This suggests that the observed gains cannot be explained merely by a more favorable random initialization,
 but reflect a more effective overall training mechanism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the dataset level,
 the proposed machine-learning model is dominant:
 it delivers the lowest error on 17 out of 21 datasets and ties for best on one additional dataset,
 while being outperformed on only three datasets.
 The advantage is particularly pronounced on problems where the genetic variants exhibit large errors or strong sensitivity to initialization,
 such as BL,
 HO,
 LW,
 SN,
 MORTGAGE,
 and HOUSING,
 where the proposed approach yields substantially smaller values than all genetic initializations.
 The few exceptions occur on AIRFOIL and STOCK,
 and also on FRIEDMAN where the genetic variants attain lower error.
 Overall,
 Table 9 supports that while initialization choice improves genetic training to some extent,
 it does not match the consistently stronger regression performance of the proposed machine-learning model across the benchmark suite.

 reports statistical significance levels for the classification experiments comparing the proposed machine-learning model against four genetic-training variants that differ by their initialization distribution.
 The overall Friedman test yields 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2.48\times10^{-9}$
\end_inset

,
 an extremely small value indicating that performance differences among the methods are real and cannot be attributed to random variability.
 In other words,
 across the dataset suite,
 the alternative genetic initializations and the proposed approach lead to measurably different performance behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pairwise comparisons against the proposed model show statistically supported differences in all cases.
 Specifically,
 GENETIC (UNIFORM) vs the proposed model and GENETIC (XAVIER) vs the proposed model both yield 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1.25\times10^{-5}$
\end_inset

,
 providing very strong evidence of a difference well below the 
\begin_inset Formula $p<0.0001$
\end_inset

 threshold.
 The GENETIC (XE) comparison is even more decisive with 
\begin_inset Formula $p=6.79\times10^{-8}$
\end_inset

,
 also far below 
\begin_inset Formula $0.0001$
\end_inset

.
 The GENETIC (LECUN) comparison yields 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.0149$
\end_inset

,
 which remains significant at the 0.05 level but is clearly weaker,
 consistent with this variant being the most competitive among the genetic baselines.
 Overall,
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 confirms that the proposed method’s advantage over the genetic variants is not only reflected in mean error rates,
 but is also statistically substantiated across the full set of classification experiments.

 reports R-based statistical significance levels for comparisons between the proposed machine-learning model and four genetic variants that differ by their initialization distribution,
 using the regression experiment results.
 The overall Friedman test yields 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1.06\times10^{-5}$
\end_inset

,
 which strongly rejects the hypothesis that all methods behave equivalently across the regression datasets.
 Therefore,
 at the suite level,
 the genetic-initialization choices and the proposed approach lead to performance differences that are unlikely to be explained by random variation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pairwise comparisons show that the strength of separation depends on the specific genetic variant.
 GENETIC(UNIFORM) vs the proposed model and GENETIC(XE) vs the proposed model yield 
\begin_inset Formula $p=1.03\times10^{-4}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p=4.98\times10^{-4}$
\end_inset

,
 respectively,
 both below 
\begin_inset Formula $0.001$
\end_inset

 and thus extremely significant,
 providing strong evidence that the proposed method differs from these two initializations.
 In contrast,
 the comparisons against GENETIC(XAVIER) and GENETIC(LECUN) give 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.0941$
\end_inset

,
 which is above 
\begin_inset Formula $0.05$
\end_inset

,
 so a statistically significant difference is not supported under the standard threshold.
 Overall,
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 suggests that the proposed approach is statistically superior relative to the weaker genetic initializations,
 while against the more competitive genetic choices the observed differences are not large enough to rule out random experimental variability.

Experiments with the cooling strategy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An additional experiment was executed where the cooling strategy was altered,
 in order to verify the robustness of the proposed method.
 In this experiment the following strategies were used:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Exponential decreasing (EXP),
 the temperature is decreased using the following equation:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T=T_{0}a^{k},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 defines the current iteration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Logarithmical multiplicative cooling (LOG),
 where the following formula is used:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{k}=\frac{T_{0}}{1+a\log\left(1+k\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Linear multiplicative cooling (LINEAR),
 using the following formula:
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{k}=\frac{T_{0}}{1+ak}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Quadratic multiplicative cooling (QUAD),
 with the following formula:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
T_{k}=\frac{T_{0}}{1+ak^{2}}
\]

\end_inset

\end_inset

,
 the classification error rate (%) is reported for 34 datasets under four cooling schedules (EXP,
 LOG,
 LINEAR,
 QUAD) within the proposed model,
 where lower values indicate better performance.
 In terms of average error,
 EXP provides the best overall result (20.57%),
 while LOG (20.88%) and LINEAR (20.87%) are essentially tied and very close,
 and QUAD yields the highest average (21.01%).
 Although the average differences are small,
 the best schedule can be dataset-dependent,
 and some datasets exhibit higher sensitivity to the cooling choice (e.g.,
 SEGMENT and WINE).

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

,
 the reported values are the errors (lower is better) on 21 regression datasets,
 obtained by using four cooling schedules (EXP,
 LOG,
 LINEAR,
 QUAD) within the proposed model.
 If we focus on the overall picture,
 LOG has the lowest average error (5.16),
 EXP and LINEAR are essentially the same (5.33),
 and QUAD is slightly higher (5.42).
 In other words,
 the average differences are modest and do not suggest a single schedule that clearly dominates everywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the dataset level,
 however,
 the picture is less uniform.
 There are datasets where the cooling choice seems to matter more such as BL,
 HOUSING,
 FRIEDMAN,
 and STOCK because the gaps between schedules become noticeably larger.
 In contrast,
 datasets like CONCRETE,
 HO,
 and LASER remain almost unchanged across schedules,
 indicating that performance there is largely insensitive to how temperature is decreased.
 If a single,
 simple default must be used without per-dataset tuning,
 LOG is the most reasonable choice because it yields the best average.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental evidence indicates that the proposed method should be interpreted as a training pipeline rather than as a minor optimizer tweak.
 Its key design choice is a preliminary bound-selection stage that constrains the admissible weight ranges before the main optimization.
 This stage is implemented via a Simulated Annealing variant and is motivated by limiting regimes in which sigmoid units saturate,
 since large-magnitude inputs can yield near-constant outputs and degrade effective learning dynamics and generalization.
 Final training is then carried out inside the selected bounds through a Genetic optimization stage followed by local refinement with BFGS,
 so the intended benefit arises from combining a restricted search domain with a global stochastic search and a local convergence phase.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On classification benchmarks,
 the reported results are consistent with a systematic advantage.
 The proposed model achieves the best aggregate performance with an average classification error of 20.57%,
 while the closest competing average is GENETIC at 26.55%,
 corresponding to a 5.97 percentage-point absolute gain (approximately 22.5% relative error reduction).
 The advantage is also reported to remain sizable against the remaining baselines and is accompanied by the lowest dispersion of errors (standard deviation ≈ 14.31),
 which is compatible with more stable behavior across heterogeneous classification tasks.
 At the dataset level,
 PROPOSED attains the best result on 23 of 34 datasets and ranks within the top two on 31/34 datasets,
 supporting that the superiority is not driven by a small subset of cases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The statistical analysis for classification further supports that these differences are unlikely to be attributable to random variation.
 The overall Friedman test yields 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2.89\times10^{-11}$
\end_inset

,
 strongly rejecting the hypothesis of equivalent performance across methods.
 Post-hoc comparisons against PROPOSED are significant for all main baselines,
 with extremely small p-values against ADAM and BFGS,
 a highly decisive result against PRUNE,
 and still highly significant differences against GENETIC and RBF (p-values below 
\begin_inset Formula $0.01$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For regression,
 the overall picture is positive but requires more conservative phrasing.
 PROPOSED attains the lowest mean absolute error (MAE = 5.33) and the overall Friedman test remains significant 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p=1.55\times10^{-4}\right)$
\end_inset

,
 indicating that genuine performance differences exist across the regression suite.
 However,
 pairwise evidence is more nuanced:
 the strongest statistically supported advantage is observed primarily against BFGS 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p=3.35\times10^{-4}\right)$
\end_inset

 and more weakly (but still significantly) against GENETIC (
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.0113$
\end_inset

),
 whereas differences relative to ADAM,
 RBF,
 and PRUNE are not supported at the 0.05 level.
 In addition,
 regression errors span a wide dynamic range and can be heavy-tailed,
 so robustness and variability across datasets materially affect the interpretation of mean outcomes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sensitivity experiments help identify which settings appear critical under the tested conditions.
 Variations of pc are reported not to yield measurable statistical differences (for both classification and regression),
 suggesting that pc is not a critical parameter within the explored range.
 In contrast,
 Iw shows a marginal overall effect in classification (overall 
\begin_inset Formula $p=0.0423$
\end_inset

),
 but without strong pairwise confirmation,
 implying modest and distributed differences rather than a clear,
 sharply separated setting.
 This supports the interpretation that the dominant performance driver is the bound-selection mechanism and the overall pipeline structure,
 rather than fine tuning of auxiliary parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A central and practically relevant trade-off is computational cost.
 The Simulated Annealing bound-selection phase requires repeated evaluations and may dominate runtime.
 This is directly reflected in the reported runtime comparison as a function of network size:
 for 2 nodes,
 GA averages 11.34 versus 213.21 for PROPOSED,
 for 5 nodes,
 29.18 versus 420.43,
 and for 10 nodes,
 57.95 versus 790.35.
 Consequently,
 the method is best positioned for settings where accuracy and robustness gains justify higher offline computation,
 rather than as a default choice under strict training-time constraints.
 Finally,
 the current validation targets sigmoid feed-forward networks and a saturation-driven rationale,
 it has not yet been demonstrated that the same gains transfer to deep networks or truly high-dimensional parameterizations without additional evaluation and potentially redesigning the underlying bound-selection criterion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several directions follow naturally for future work.
 Firstly,
 the proposed technique could be applied to other cases of artificial neural networks such as,
 for example,
 deep neural networks,
 although the required execution time would be quite long due to the complexity and number of parameters in these machine learning models.
 One possible solution to this problem could be the incorporation of parallel versions of the Simulated Annealing algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "psa1,psa2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that can take advantage of the modern computational environments.
 Second,
 the fitness definition used during the Simulated Annealing phase should be redesigned to incorporate explicit generalization criteria,
 such as validation error or robustness to noise,
 so that the bound-selection stage more directly targets out-of-sample performance.
 Third,
 the cost-benefit trade-off should be quantified systematically,
 and CPU or GPU parallelization should be explored,
 since the Simulated Annealing phase requires repeated evaluations and may dominate the overall runtime.
