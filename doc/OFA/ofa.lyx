\begin_layout Abstract
The problem of finding the global minimum of a function is applicable to
 a multitude of real-world problems, and for this reason a variety of computatio
nal techniques have been developed to efficiently locate it.
 Among these techniques, evolutionary techniques play a central role, which
 seek, through the imitation of natural processes, to efficiently obtain
 the global minimum of multidimensional functions.
 An evolutionary technique that has recently been introduced is the optimal
 foraging algorithm, which is a swarm - based algorithm, and it is notable
 for its reliability in locating the global minimum.
 In this work, a series of modifications are proposed that aim to improve
 the reliability and speed of the above technique, such as a termination
 technique based on stochastic observations, an innovative sampling method
 and a technique to improve the generation of offspring.
 The new method was tested on a series of problems from the relevant literature
 and a comparative study was made against other global optimization techniques
 with promising results.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic goal of global optimization is to find the global minimum by searching
 for the appropriate scope of each problem.
 Primarily, a global optimization method aims to discover the global minimum
 of a continuous function, and it is defined as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x^{*}=\mbox{arg}\min_{x\in S}f(x)\label{eq:eq1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S=\left[a_{1},b_{1}\right]\times\left[a_{2},b_{2}\right]\times\ldots\left[a_{n},b_{n}\right]
\]

\end_inset

Global optimization is a core part of applied mathematics

 and computer science 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Additionally, it finds application in various fields such as physics

, medicine 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 etc.
 Optimization methods are divided into deterministic and stochastic 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "go_comparison"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Deterministic methods guarantee finding the global optimal solution and
 are usually applied to small problems 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "go_det_vs_stochastic"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The most commonly appeared techniques of the first category are the so
 - called interval techniques 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "interval1,interval2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which divide the initial domain of the function until it discovers a promising
 subset that may contain the global minimum.
 On the other hand, stochastic methods do not guarantee finding the global
 optimization and are mainly applied to large problems, but are inefficient
 when nonlinear equality constraints are involved.
 Stochastic methods include a variety of techniques, such as Controlled
 Random Search methods

 Also, in the recent literature, a variety of hybrid methods have appeared
 that combine different optimization techniques 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Furthermore, due to the widespread usage of parallel programming architectures,
 a variety of methods have been proposed that take advantage of such systems

An important group of stochastic techniques that has attracted the interest
 of many researchers is the group of evolutionary techniques.
 The branch of evolutionary computing includes the study of foundations
 and applications of computational techniques based on the principles of
 natural evolution.
 Evolution in nature is responsible for the "design" of all living things
 on earth and the strategies they use to interact with each other.
 This branch of methods includes Differential Evolution methods

\begin_layout Standard
The current work introduces a series of modifications to the OFA algorithm
 in order to speed up the process and to increase the effectiveness of the
 algorithm.
 These modifications include:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Incorporation of a sampling technique that utilizes the K-Means method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kmeansNew"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The points that will be sampled will more accurately and quickly lead to
 the global minimum of the function and additional points that might have
 been close enough using another sampling technique will be discarded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use a termination technique based on stochastic observations.
 At each iteration of the algorithm, the smallest functional value is recorded.
 If this remains constant for a predetermined number of iterations, then
 the method terminates.
 This way, the method will terminate in time without needlessly wasting
 computing time on iterations that will simply produce the same result.

\begin_layout Itemize
Improving the offspring produced by the method using a few steps of a local
 minimization method.
 In the current work, a BFGS variant

The proposed method

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The OFA algorithm uses nature as a source of inspiration.
 The OFA algorithm has as its main purpose the evolution of the population
 using some iterative steps which will be presented in more detail below.
 The quality of the initial population can be improved, allowing the search
 space to be explored more efficiently.
 The first major modification introduced to the above technique is the use
 of a sophisticated technique of sampling points from the objective function.
 This sampling is based on the K-means technique and is presented in detail
 in the subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:The-proposed-sampling"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The second modification is to apply a few steps of a local search procedure
 in offspring creation, if an offspring is not consistent with the bounds
 
\begin_inset Formula $[a,b]$
\end_inset

 of the objective function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

.
 With this modification, it is ensured that a new point will be within the
 field definition of the function on the one hand, and on the other hand,
 it will have a slightly lower value than its predecessor.
 The third modification is to use an efficient termination rule to terminate
 the global optimization method effectively.
 This termination rule is outlined in subsection

As can be seen, the present method drastically reduces the required number
 of function calls to almost all objective functions.
 This, of course, also results in a significant reduction of the required
 computing time for finding the global minimum.
 Furthermore, an additional experiment was done in order to measure the
 importance of the K-means sampling in the proposed method.
 In this test, 3 different sampling methods were used in the proposed method:

\begin_layout Enumerate
The column UNIFORM stands for the application of uniform sampling in the
 proposed method.

\begin_layout Enumerate
The column TRIANGULAR represents the application of the triangular distribution

 to sample the initial points of the proposed method.

 The proposed sampling method significantly outperforms the remaining sampling
 techniques in almost all problems.
 Furthermore, the proposed global optimization technique outperforms the
 rest of the compared techniques, even if a different sampling technique
 is used.

Furthermore, an additional test was carried out, where the function ELP
 was used to measure the effectiveness of the proposed method, as the dimension
 increased.
 This function is defined as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(10^{6}\right)^{\frac{i-1}{n-1}}x_{i}^{2}
\]

\end_inset

where the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 defines the dimension of the function.

The required number of calls for the current method increases at a much
 lower rate than in the case of the Genetic Algorithm.
 This means that the method can cope with large-scale problems without significa
ntly increasing the required computing time.

\begin_layout Standard
Three modifications were proposed to the EOFA optimization method in this
 article.
 The modifications are primarily aimed at improving the efficiency and speed
 of the global optimization algorithm.
 The first modification proposed the application of a sampling technique
 which incorporates the K-Means method
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "kmeansNew"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 With the proposed modification, the points where the sampling was achieved
 helped to find the global minimum with the greatest accuracy and in the
 least possible time.
 The second amendment concerns termination rules.
 Termination rules hel terminate functions immediately without unnecessarily
 wasting computational time on iterations.
 The third modification concerns the refinement of the offspring produced
 using the BFGS method 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Powell"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 as a local search procedure.
 In the experiments conducted, different sampling techniques were used for
 the proposed method.
 More specifically, the following techniques were used: Uniform, Triangular,
 K-means where it was found that the K-means sampling technique yields much
 better results than the other two techniques and the total number of calls
 is extremely lower.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Experiments were also performed using different optimization methods.
 More specifically, the following were used: Genetic, PSO, EOFA where it
 was observed that the average number of EOFA calls is very limited compared
 to the other two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the experimental results have been shown to be extremely promising,
 further efforts can be made to develop the technique in various areas.
 Among the future extensions of the application may be the use of parallel
 computing techniques to speed up the optimization process, such as the
 integration of MPI
