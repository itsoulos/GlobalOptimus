\begin_layout Abstract
Global optimization represents a fundamental challenge in computer science and engineering,
 as it aims to identify high-quality solutions to problems spanning from moderate to extremely high dimensionality.
 The DE algorithm is a population-based algorithm like genetic algorithms and uses similar operators such as:
 crossover,
 mutation and selection.
 The proposed method introduces a set of methodological enhancements designed to increase both the robustness and the computational efficiency of the classical DE framework.
 Specifically,
 an adaptive termination criterion is incorporated,
 enabling early stopping based on statistical measures of convergence and population stagnation.
 Furthermore,
 a population sampling strategy based on k-means clustering is employed to enhance exploration and improve the redistribution of individuals in high-dimensional search spaces.
 This mechanism enables structured population renewal and effectively mitigates premature convergence.
 The enhanced algorithm was evaluated on standard large-scale numerical optimization benchmarks and compared with established global optimization methods.
 The experimental results indicate substantial improvements in convergence speed,
 scalability,
 and solution stability.

A particular challenge is the large-scale global optimization (LSGO) problem,
 where the complexity increases significantly with increasing problem dimensions.
 Finding efficient and computationally feasible solutions has become particularly difficult,
 which has led the research community to focus on the development of innovative algorithms.
 LSGO problems are encountered in a wide range of applications,
 while their importance is also reflected in the organization of the first global large-scale optimization competition within the framework of the CEC in 2008.
 Other competitions followed in 2010

Differential Evolution (DE) is one of the most widely used optimization techniques,
 as it offers high robustness,
 simplicity and fast convergence.
 DE is a highly efficient evolutionary algorithm that has gained significant recognition since the late 1990s.
 DE,
 originally introduced in 1995 by Storn and Price 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "key-1,key-2-1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

,
 has proven to be a versatile optimization tool that can be applied in various scientific and engineering fields.
 It is particularly effective for symmetric optimization problems,
 as well as for dealing with discontinuous,
 noisy,
 and dynamic challenges.
 In physics,
 it has been used in energy-related problems,
 including wind power optimization.
 In chemistry,
 it has contributed to advances in atmospheric chemistry 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "key-1-1"
literal "false"

\end_inset

and the development of high-performance chemical reactors.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "key-2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 DE has also had significant implications in health-related areas,
 such as breast cancer research 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "key-3"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and medical diagnostics.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "key-4"
literal "false"

\end_inset

Despite its effectiveness,
 DE has some limitations,
 such as the difficulty of adapting its parameters to different problems and its reduced performance in high-dimensional environments.
 Furthermore,
 while it has a powerful exploration mechanism,
 it often lags in exploiting the identified solutions,
 which can slow down the convergence process.
 To address these challenges,
 several improved versions of DE have been proposed.
 The goal of these improvements is to achieve a better balance between exploration and exploitation,
 parameter adaptability,
 and more effectively handle large-scale problems.
 The continuous research activity in this field demonstrates the importance of LSGO and the need to develop increasingly efficient algorithms to deal with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The current work introduces a number of modifications to the DE algorithm in order to speed up the process and increase the efficiency of the algorithm,
 especially for large - scale problems.
 The modifications introduced in DE aim to improve performance on large-scale problems.
 In more detail:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sampling Method:
 The use of k-means for sampling contributes to improving the quality of the initial solutions and reducing the dimensional complexity,
 leading to faster convergence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Termination Technique for Differential Evolution:
 The proposed technique allows for early termination of the process when no significant improvement is observed,
 thus reducing the number of unnecessary evaluations of the objective function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Different mechanisms for the differential weighted parameter:
 The integration of Number,
 Random and Migrant approaches allows greater adaptability of the algorithm to the requirements of each problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Periodic Local Optimization Refinement:
 The use of local methods,
 such as BFGS,
 contributes to further improving the solutions,
 increasing the accuracy of the final results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The combined use of these techniques enhances the efficiency and reliability of DE in large-scale problems,
 offering a more efficient way of searching for solutions.

\begin_inset Formula $NP$

 typically set as

 where n is the problem's dimensionality.
 We define the crossover probability 
\begin_inset Formula $CR$
\end_inset

 with a default value of 0.9 and the differential weight 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 with a default value of 0.8.
 We randomly initialize all members of the population,
 referred to as agents,
 within the search space.
 The method iterates until a termination criterion is met.
 In each iteration,
 for every agent 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 in the population,
 we randomly select three distinct agents 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 and 
\series bold
c
\series default
.
 We then choose a random index 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 from 1 to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 Next,
 we construct a trial vector y by computing,
 for each component j,
 the value 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{j}=a_{j}+F\times\left(b_{j}-c_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 if a random number

 otherwise,
 we keep 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{j}=x_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 If the objective function value 
\begin_inset Formula $f(y)$
\end_inset

 is better than or equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x_{i})$
\end_inset

,
 we replace 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 At the end of the process,
 we return the best-performing agent 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{best}$

 which has the optimal objective function value.
 The method combines stochastic search with directional variations derived from differences between population agents,
 ensuring an efficient exploration-exploitation balance in the search space.

2.3 The Flowchart of the proposed Differential Evolution method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The steps of the proposed DE algorithm can be described as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The process begins by initializing the basic parameters,
 including population size,
 differential weight values,
 and crossover probabilities.
 The initial population is then generated,
 either uniformly distributed over the search space or clustered using the k-means algorithm.
 Once the initial population is determined,
 the fitness of each individual is evaluated and stored in a fitness table.
 At this stage,
 a differential weight calculation method is selected,
 with Stable,
 Random or Migrant options.
 Likewise,
 the sampling procedure for generating new solutions is specified,
 which may include tournament selection or random sampling.
 To further refine the candidate solutions,
 a local search procedure is applied,
 improving the quality of the trial solutions.
 The algorithm then checks the termination criteria to decide whether to proceed or terminate.
 If the criteria are still not met,
 the process returns to update the fitness table and continues to repeat.
 If the termination criteria are met,
 the algorithm outputs the best solution found.

\begin_layout Standard
A series of experiments were carried out for the previously mentioned functions and these experiments were executed on an AMD RYZEN 5950X with 128GB RAM.
 The operating system of the running machine was Debian Linux.
 Each experiment was conducted 30 times,
 with different random numbers each time,
 and the averages were recorded.
 The software used in the experiments was coded in ANSI C++ using the freely available optimization environment of OPTIMUS

In the following tables that depict the experimental results,
 the numbers in cells stand for the average function calls,
 as measured on 30 independent runs.
 The numbers in parentheses denote the fraction of the executions where the method successfully discovered the global minimum.
 If this number is not present,
 then the method managed to locate the global minimum in every run (100% success).

 PROPOSED) across a wide range of test functions with dimensions of 25,
 50,
 100,
 and 150.
 Each row corresponds to a test function,
 while the columns represent the methods.
 The numerical values in each cell indicate the number of objective function calls required to find the minimum,
 while the values in parentheses show the success rate of each method in each case.
 In the last row (TOTAL),
 the total sum of function calls for each method is displayed,
 along with the average success rate.
 The best methods should simultaneously exhibit a low number of function calls (efficiency) and a high success rate (reliability).
 The analysis shows that the Proposed method delivers strong and consistent performance.
 Its overall success rate (0.85) is comparable to those of GA,
 MLSHADESPA,
 SHADE_ILS,
 IPSO,
 DE and WOA (around 0.90),
 and distinctly higher than the BICCA method (0.73).
 This indicates that the Proposed method remains dependable in locating the global minimum even when faced with complex or high-dimensional search spaces.
 In terms of computational cost,
 the Proposed method requires a total of 387,335 objective function evaluations,
 which is substantially lower than most competing techniques.
 This advantage appears consistently across the majority of tested functions.
 For example,
 in the DifferentPowers function,
 the Proposed method significantly outperforms GA across all dimensionalities:
 at 25 dimensions it uses 6,478 evaluations compared to 14,495 for GA at 100 dimensions,
 16,225 versus 28,413 and at 150 dimensions,
 21,495 versus 33,569.
 Similar observations are made for the GriewankRosenbrock function,
 where the Proposed method demonstrates clear efficiency benefits:
 at 100 dimensions it requires 6,465 evaluations whereas BICCA needs 20,462,
 and at 150 dimensions the gap widens further with 7,272 evaluations compared to 30,604 for BICCA.
 These differences illustrate the method’s robustness and its ability to maintain low computational demands in highly nonlinear and difficult optimization landscapes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary,
 the findings suggest that the Proposed method offers a strong balance between reliability and computational efficiency.
 It competes effectively with and in many cases surpasses widely used optimization algorithms,
 while maintaining a consistently lower number of objective function evaluations.
 Its stability across different functions and dimensions confirms its applicability to a broad range of optimization scenarios,
 making it a promising and efficient alternative within the field of evolutionary and metaheuristic optimization.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of function evaluations for the PROPOSED optimizer compared with all baseline algorithms.
 A Kruskal–Wallis test confirms strong overall differences across methods (p < 2.2e-16),
 indicating that the optimizers do not come from the same underlying distribution.
 The PROPOSED method consistently exhibits substantially lower function-call counts,
 with both its median and dispersion markedly smaller than those of all competing algorithms.
 The results,
 combined with the consistently lower function-call requirements displayed in the figure,
 indicate that the superiority of the PROPOSED optimizer is highly unlikely to be attributable to random variation.
 Instead,
 it reflects a systematic and robust performance advantage over all baseline methods.

 presents the impact of the three differential weight strategies NUMBER(T),
 RANDOM(T),
 and MIGRANT(T) on the performance of the algorithm across a broad set of benchmark functions,
 where (T) denotes tournament–based selection.
 The results clearly show that MIGRANT(T) is by far the most efficient method..
 The MIGRANT(T) strategy consistently achieves the best outcomes,
 requiring the fewest objective function evaluations overall (387,335) compared with NUMBER(T) (527,444) and RANDOM(T) (543,201).
 This improvement is particularly noteworthy given that all three strategies achieve the same overall success rate (0.85),
 indicating that the performance advantage arises purely from efficiency rather than reliability differences.
 This trend is visible across multiple test functions.
 In the Attractive Sector family (25–150 dimensions),
 MIGRANT(T) demonstrates uniformly superior performance.
 For example,
 in Attractive Sector_25,
 it requires 1697 calls,
 compared with 1743 for NUMBER(T) and 1756 for RANDOM(T).
 As dimensionality increases,
 this advantage becomes even more pronounced.
 The performance gap becomes even more substantial in multimodal landscapes such as Buche–Rastrigin.
 In Buche Rastrigin_25,
 MIGRANT(T) needs 5893 function calls (success rate 0.90),
 significantly fewer than NUMBER(T) (12,243) and RANDOM(T) (12,035).
 The difference becomes overwhelming in the highest-dimensional case (Buche Rastrigin_150):
 MIGRANT(T) completes the optimization with 23,466 calls,
 while NUMBER(T) requires 40,240,
 and RANDOM(T) needs 39,263.
 These results underline MIGRANT(T)’s superior adaptability in sharply multimodal and high-variance landscapes.
 For example,
 Ellipsoidal_150 is solved in 16,930 calls by MIGRANT(T),
 compared with 19,311 for NUMBER(T) and 19,940 for RANDOM(T).
 This difference becomes particularly important for large-scale smooth problems,
 where maintaining efficiency is critical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 the evidence strongly indicates that MIGRANT(T) is the most effective differential weight mechanism among the tested variants.
 It consistently reduces the number of function evaluations across a wide variety of functions both unimodal and multimodal while preserving identical success rates.
 This combination of efficiency,
 robustness,
 and stability makes MIGRANT(T) a particularly advantageous choice for enhancing the performance of Differential Evolution in high-dimensional and challenging optimization scenarios.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 3 presents the pairwise statistical analysis of the three migration strategies MIGRANT (T),
 NUMBER (T),
 and RANDOM (T) based on their required function evaluations.
 According to the Kruskal–Wallis test (p = 0.3),
 no statistically significant overall difference is detected among the three strategies,
 indicating that their distributions of function calls are broadly comparable.
 Pairwise t-tests further support this conclusion:
 none of the comparisons reach conventional significance thresholds (ns:
 p > 0.05),
 demonstrating that the observed differences in median and variability across the strategies are not statistically meaningful.
 Although the MIGRANT (T) strategy tends to exhibit slightly lower function-call counts on average,
 these differences fall within the range of natural stochastic variation.
 Collectively,
 these findings suggest that the three strategies perform similarly with respect to computational cost.

compares the four selection strategies RANDOM(R),
 RANDOM(T),
 MIGRANT(R),
 and MIGRANT(T),
 where (R) denotes purely random selection and (T) denotes tournament–based selection.
 The results clearly show that MIGRANT(T) is by far the most efficient method.
 It achieves the lowest total number of objective function evaluations (387,335),
 significantly outperforming MIGRANT(R) (962,599),
 RANDOM(T) (543,201),
 and RANDOM(R) (767,225).
 Since all methods achieve the same success rate (0.85),
 the performance differences are due solely to efficiency,
 demonstrating the importance of the selection mechanism.
 This advantage becomes evident across nearly all tested functions.
 For the Attractive Sector family (25–150 dimensions),
 MIGRANT(T) consistently requires the fewest evaluations.
 For example,
 in Attractive Sector_25,
 it needs only 1697 calls,
 compared to 2174 MIGRANT(R),
 1756 for RANDOM(T) and as many as 2162 for RANDOM(R).
 The differences are even more striking for multimodal benchmarks such as Buche–Rastrigin.
 In the 25-dimensional case,
 MIGRANT(T) achieves 5893 calls (0.90 success),
 while MIGRANT(R) needs 15,894,
 RANDOM(T) needs 12,035,
 and RANDOM(R) 11,921.
 At the 150-dimensional level,
 the gap widens dramatically:
 MIGRANT(T) requires 23,466 calls,
 whereas MIGRANT(R) rises to 77,590,
 RANDOM(T) 39,263 and RANDOM(R) to 54,663.
 These results highlight the strong stabilizing effect that tournament selection has on the MIGRANT mechanism.
 The superiority of MIGRANT(T) is even more pronounced in the Sharp Ridge functions.
 In Sharp Ridge_150,
 MIGRANT(T) completes the optimization with 6481 calls,
 while MIGRANT(R) requires 12,053,
 RANDOM(T) 8237,
 and RANDOM(R) 12,395.
 Finally,
 in the Zakharov functions,
 MIGRANT(T) again shows consistently superior performance.
 In Zakharov_150,
 MIGRANT(T) needs just 6304 calls,
 compared to 25,370 for MIGRANT(R),
 7553 RANDOM(T) and 16,240 for RANDOM(R).
 Even in the easier 25-dimensional case,
 MIGRANT(T) requires 2185 calls,
 whereas RANDOM(R) requires over twice as many (4605).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 these results highlight the strong interaction between the MIGRANT mechanism and tournament selection.
 Tournament selection dramatically enhances the performance of MIGRANT,
 reducing the computational cost by large margins across all functions while preserving identical success rates.
 As a result,
 MIGRANT(T) emerges as the most balanced,
 stable,
 and efficient strategy,
 making it highly suitable for optimization scenarios where minimizing objective function evaluations is essential.

Figure 4 presents the pairwise statistical analysis between the four strategies MIGRANT(T),
 MIGRANT(R),
 RANDOM(T),
 and RANDOM(R) based on their function-call distributions.
 A Kruskal–Wallis test reports a statistically significant overall difference among the groups (p = 0.0019),
 indicating that at least one strategy differs meaningfully from the others.
 To further investigate these differences,
 pairwise t-tests were conducted,
 and the resulting p-values were annotated using the standard significance notation (ns:
 p > 0.05,
 :
 p < 0.05,
 *:
 p < 0.01,
 ***:
 p < 0.001,
 ****:
 p < 0.0001).
 The results show that MIGRANT(T) performs significantly better than both MIGRANT(R) and RANDOM(R),
 achieving **level differences against the highest-cost configuration.
 Additionally,
 MIGRANT(R) and RANDOM(T) exhibit intermediate performance,
 with several comparisons reaching or *** significance levels,
 indicating meaningful but less pronounced differences.
 Comparisons classified as "ns" suggest that some pairs have statistically indistinguishable behavior.
 Overall,
 the distribution of function calls shows that the MIGRANT-based strategies,
 particularly MIGRANT(T),
 tend to require fewer evaluations,
 demonstrating stronger computational efficiency relative to the RANDOM variants.

 tournament selection is used to choose the samples that participate in the core operator of Differential Evolution.
 Four strategies for computing the differential weight are evaluated:
 random weight with uniform sampling (Random(U)),
 random weight with k-means sampling (Random(K)),
 MIGRANT weight with uniform sampling (Migrant(U)),
 and MIGRANT weight with k-means sampling (Migrant(K)).
 The k-means method,
 originally proposed by MacQueen

 and used extensively in later work [65,
 66],
 is employed not only to determine cluster centers but also as a structured sampling mechanism.
 Across all test functions,
 MIGRANT(K) consistently achieves the lowest total number of function calls (387,335) with a success rate of 0.85,
 outperforming all other sampling strategies.
 This advantage becomes clear when examining individual benchmarks.
 For the Attractive Sector family (dimensions 25–150),
 MIGRANT(K) systematically requires fewer evaluations than MIGRANT(U) and both Random methods.
 For example,
 in Attractive Sector_25,
 MIGRANT(K) uses only 1697 evaluations compared to 1738for MIGRANT(U),
 while Random(K) and Random(U) require 1756 and 1792 respectively.
 This pattern holds across all dimensionalities,
 showing the benefit of structured sampling in unimodal landscapes.
 The effect becomes far more pronounced in multimodal functions such as Buche–Rastrigin.
 In Buche Rastrigin_25,
 MIGRANT(K) needs 5893 function calls with a success rate of 0.90,
 in contrast to MIGRANT(U)'s 12,818 calls (0.03).
 Random(K) performs similarly to MIGRANT(K) in success rate but requires more evaluations (12,035),
 while Random(U) is by far the least efficient (28,865 calls).
 The difference becomes dramatic in higher dimensions:
 in Buche Rastrigin_150,
 MIGRANT(K) performs the task in 23,466 calls (0.27),
 whereas Random(U) escalates to 90,211,
 showing the instability of uniform sampling in complex landscapes.
 Although differences here are smaller due to the problem’s structure,
 MIGRANT(K) preserves its advantage in stability.
 The superiority of MIGRANT(K) is again evident in the Step Ellipsoidal group.
 In Step Ellipsoidal_25,
 MIGRANT(K) requires only 5104 calls,
 remarkably lower than Random(U) (6699),
 Random (K) (6026) and still better than MIGRANT(U) (5014,
 but with lower success).
 Finally,
 for the Zakharov functions,
 MIGRANT(K) again shows the best balance between evaluation cost and success rate.
 In Zakharov_25,
 MIGRANT(K) requires only 2185 evaluations,
 beating Migrant(U) (2283),
 Random(K) (2639) and Random(U) (2797).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 integrating k-means sampling into the MIGRANT strategy leads to substantial improvements in both efficiency and reliability.
 MIGRANT(K) not only requires the fewest total function evaluations but also maintains high success rates across diverse problem categories,
 making it the most effective approach for the benchmark set.
 In contrast,
 Random(U) repeatedly demonstrates the lowest efficiency,
 highlighting the advantage of structured sampling over uniform dispersion in high-dimensional optimization.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 5 presents the pairwise t-tests statistical comparison of the four strategies (MIGRANT(K),
 RANDOM(K),
 MIGRANT(U),
 and RANDOM(U)) based on their function-call distributions.
 A Kruskal–Wallis test indicates a statistically significant overall difference among the groups (p = 0.034),
 suggesting that at least one strategy exhibits a distinct performance profile.
 Pairwise t-tests,
 corrected using the conventional significance notation (ns:
 p > 0.05,
 :
 p < 0.05,
 *:
 p < 0.01,
 *:
 p < 0.001,
 :
 p < 0.0001),
 reveal that MIGRANT(K) differs very significantly from RANDOM(K) and significantly from MIGRANT(U).
 In contrast,
 the difference between MIGRANT(U) and RANDOM(U) is not statistically significant (ns).
 Taken together,
 these results show that strategies based on migration with K-type selection (MIGRANT(K)) demonstrate consistently lower function-call requirements,
 while the U-type variants display comparable behavior to the RANDOM(U) baseline.
 Overall,
 the statistical evidence suggests that the K-based migration mechanism yields a measurable performance advantage relative to the other strategies.

 we observe the influence of periodic local optimization on the performance of the MIGRANT method,
 considering four different local search rates:
 0.005,
 0.01,
 0.03,
 and 0.05.
 Among all settings,
 the 0.005 rate achieves the lowest total number of function calls (148,027) while maintaining a high success rate of 0.85,
 thus providing the best balance between computational efficiency and optimization reliability.
 This advantage is consistently reflected across the benchmark functions.
 In the Attractive Sector functions (25–150 dimensions),
 the 0.005 rate clearly outperforms the higher-rate configurations.
 For instance,
 in Attractive Sector_25,
 it requires only 1441 calls,
 compared to 1603 for the 0.03 rate and 1697 for the 0.05 rate.
 The improvement persists as the dimensionality increases:
 Attractive Sector_150 is solved with 1536 calls at the 0.005 rate,
 while the 0.05 rate requires 1867 calls.
 The improvement becomes dramatically more pronounced in the Buche–Rastrigin family,
 where the complexity and multimodality amplify the benefit of lower local search frequency.
 For Buche Rastrigin_25,
 the 0.005 method requires 2035 function calls (0.90 success),
 whereas the 0.05 rate jumps to 5893 calls nearly triple.
 In the high-dimensional case Buche Rastrigin_150,
 the difference is even more striking:
 5900 calls at the 0.005 rate versus 23,466 for the 0.05 rate.
 A similar trend can be seen in the Discus,
 Sharp Ridge,
 and Step Ellipsoidal functions.
 In Step Ellipsoidal_50,
 the 0.005 rate achieves 2136 calls (0.50),
 far below the 0.05 rate (2300).
 For Step Ellipsoidal_150,
 the 0.005 variant uses 2914 calls (0.27),
 while the 0.05 rate needs 3143 calls.
 Even in unimodal functions like Discus,
 the 0.005 method consistently leads to lower evaluation costs e.g.,
 Discus_25 requires 1525 calls vs.
 1992 for the 0.05 rate.
 The Sharp Ridge functions highlight this behavior even more strongly.
 For Sharp Ridge_25,
 the 0.005 rate requires only 1934 calls,
 in contrast to 5104 calls for the 0.05 rate more than a 2.5× increase.
 Similar improvements appear in Sharp Ridge_150,
 where the function calls rise from 2350 at 0.005 to 6481 at 0.05.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary,
 using a lower local search rate specifically the 0.005 setting results in the most efficient optimization behavior across all tested functions.
 This variant provides the lowest objective function calls without compromising success rate,
 making it the optimal choice when both efficiency and reliability are essential in high-dimensional optimization tasks.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 6 presents the pairwise statistical comparisons among the four parameter configurations (0.001,
 0.01,
 0.03,
 0.05) using Pairwise t-tests.
 The global Kruskal–Wallis test indicates a statistically significant difference across the groups (p = 2.9e-08),
 suggesting that the parameter choice has a measurable impact on the number of function evaluations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All pairwise comparisons were evaluated using independent t-tests,
 and the resulting p-values were interpreted using the conventional significance notation (ns:
 p > 0.05,
 :
 p < 0.05,
 *:
 p < 0.01,
 ***:
 p < 0.001,
 **:
 p < 0.0001).
 As illustrated in the figure,
 most pairwise differences reach * or **** levels of significance,
 highlighting strong and highly consistent differences between the examined parameter settings.
 Only a limited number of comparisons fall into the non-significant range,
 indicating that in the majority of cases each parameter configuration leads to distinguishable performance in terms of function calls.
 These results confirm that the tested parameter values influence the optimizer’s efficiency in a systematic and statistically robust manner.
 The differences detected are unlikely to be attributed to random variation and instead reflect meaningful performance changes caused by the selected parameter settings.

To further examine the practical efficiency and scalability of the proposed optimization algorithm,
 two real-world engineering design problems were investigated:
 the GasCycle

.
 These problems were selected because they differ significantly in mathematical formulation and computational complexity,
 providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating the algorithm’s performance under diverse and realistic conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each problem was tested across multiple dimensional configurations,
 ranging from 25 to 500 variables,
 in order to assess how the algorithm behaves as the search space becomes more complex.
 For every configuration,
 the execution time in seconds was recorded as the main performance indicator.
 This experimental setup enables a direct comparison of how computational efficiency changes with increasing dimensionality.

The experimental evaluation of the three algorithms demonstrates a predictable increase in execution time as the dimensionality of the problem grows,
 which aligns with the expected computational complexity of population-based optimization methods.
 In lower and medium dimensions,
 the algorithms exhibit highly comparable behavior,
 with only minor fluctuations that reflect inherent differences in their internal search mechanisms.
 As the dimensionality increases,
 more noticeable distinctions begin to emerge.
 In certain higher-dimensional cases,
 the proposed algorithm requires a longer execution time compared to the other two approaches.
 This outcome can be attributed to the structural characteristics and computational demands of its individual components,
 without implying any deficiency in its design.
 On the contrary,
 the overall performance profile of the proposed method remains consistent and closely aligned with that of the Genetic and IPSO algorithms,
 indicating that it scales reliably even as the dimensionality becomes substantially larger.
 Overall,
 the results show that all methods behave robustly with respect to execution time,
 with variations that are reasonable and expected given their algorithmic properties.
 The observed differences do not affect the general conclusion that the proposed algorithm falls well within the performance range of established techniques and maintains dependable behavior across the full spectrum of tested dimensions.

The execution time analysis for the Tandem problem demonstrates that the Proposed algorithm consistently achieves lower computational time across all tested dimensions when compared with the Genetic and IPSO methods.
 As the dimensionality increases,
 all algorithms exhibit the expected upward trend in execution time however,
 the Proposed approach maintains a steady advantage throughout the entire range.
 This consistent performance suggests that the internal structure and optimization mechanisms of the Proposed algorithm enable more efficient scaling,
 resulting in reduced computational cost even in higher-dimensional settings.
 Overall,
 the comparative results highlight the robustness and efficiency of the Proposed method,
 confirming its suitability for problems with increasing complexity.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results across all experiments paint a very clear picture:
 the choices we make in sampling,
 weighting,
 selection,
 and local search frequency strongly influence how the algorithm behaves.
 What becomes immediately noticeable is that when these components are designed in a structured and thoughtful way,
 the algorithm becomes not only faster but also far more stable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
1.
 Sampling Techniques
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the most striking findings comes from the sampling study.
 Using k-means to guide the sampling process consistently leads to better performance than uniform sampling.
 The MIGRANT(K) configuration almost always requires fewer function calls and shows much tighter distributions.
 In contrast,
 uniform sampling often spreads the search in less helpful directions,
 leading to wasteful evaluations and higher variance.
 The pairwise t-tests confirm this:
 many comparisons involving MIGRANT(K) are not just significant,
 but highly significant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
2.
 Differential weight selection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differential weight mechanism also plays a major role.
 The MIGRANT(T) method,
 which adapts the weight using information gathered during the search,
 outperforms both the NUMBER and RANDOM strategies.
 The fact that all three mechanisms achieve the same success rate makes this difference even more meaningful:
 MIGRANT(T) simply gets the job done with fewer evaluations.
 This behavior shows that giving the algorithm a way to “learn” more effectively from its population leads to smarter,
 more economical steps through the search space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
3.
 Selection Mechanisms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The impact of the selection mechanism is equally unmistakable.
 Tournament selection clearly strengthens the performance of the MIGRANT strategy.
 MIGRANT(T) is the best-performing approach across almost all functions,
 whereas MIGRANT(R) is often among the weakest.
 This suggests that random selection,
 despite its simplicity,
 can easily disrupt the search by favoring poor candidates.
 Tournament selection adds a light but meaningful pressure toward good solutions,
 which helps guide the algorithm in a more reliable direction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
4.
 Local Search Rate 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The local search experiments reveal something quite intuitive:
 applying local search too frequently can actually hurt performance.
 The lowest rate,
 0.005,
 consistently delivers the best results.
 Higher rates not only increase the cost dramatically but also introduce more noise into the optimization process.
 The Kruskal–Wallis p-values back this up,
 showing clear statistical differences between the rates.
 Essentially,
 a small and controlled dose of local search works best anything more becomes an unnecessary overhead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
5.
 Comparison with other Algorithms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When comparing the proposed approach to well-known methods such as GA,
 BICCA,
 LSHADE-SPA,
 SHADE-ILS,
 IPSO,
 WOA,
 and classical DE,
 the difference is visually and statistically unmistakable.
 The boxplots show the proposed method forming a compact,
 low-cost cluster,
 while competing algorithms display larger medians and far more variability.
 The extremely small p-values (e.g.,
 < 2.2e−16) confirm that these differences are not random.
 The proposed method is simply more efficient and more reliable across the board.
 Putting everything together,
 a common theme emerges:
 the algorithm performs best when it combines structured exploration (via k-means sampling and tournament selection) with adaptive exploitation (through MIGRANT weighting and a low-rate local search).
 This blend gives the method a kind of “balance” that many classical and modern optimizers struggle to achieve.
 It doesn’t rush into local optima,
 but it also doesn’t waste evaluations wandering aimlessly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 the findings show that the proposed approach is not just marginally better it is consistently stronger,
 more efficient,
 and more stable across a wide range of benchmark functions.
 The improvements come from thoughtful design choices rather than brute-force complexity,
 making the method both elegant and practical.
 In many ways,
 the results highlight a simple but powerful idea:
 intelligent structure beats randomness.
 When the algorithm is given meaningful guidance through sampling,
 weighting,
 and selection it becomes a far more capable optimizer.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This work explored large-scale optimization through a systematically enhanced version of the Differential Evolution algorithm.
 The improvements introduced in this study were designed to address two persistent challenges in high-dimensional optimization:
 efficiency and stability.
 Throughout the experimental analysis,
 several key components proved crucial to achieving these goals.
 A central contribution is the MIGRANT differential weight mechanism,
 which consistently outperformed both the classic NUMBER and RANDOM schemes.
 Across a wide variety of benchmark functions,
 MIGRANT(T) required significantly fewer objective function evaluations while maintaining identical success rates.
 This demonstrates that an adaptive weight strategy can guide the search more intelligently,
 reducing unnecessary evaluations and offering clear performance advantages in complex landscapes.
 Equally important was the impact of the sampling strategy.
 The results showed that k-means sampling (K) provides a strong structural advantage compared to uniform sampling.
 Configurations using MIGRANT(K) repeatedly achieved the lowest evaluation counts and exhibited far smaller variance.
 Pairwise statistical tests confirmed these differences,
 with several comparisons reaching high or very high levels of significance.
 This indicates that exploiting cluster information during sampling can greatly improve the quality and diversity of candidate solutions.
 The study also highlighted the role of the selection mechanism.
 Tournament selection consistently strengthened the algorithm’s performance,
 enabling MIGRANT(T) to outperform all Random-based variants.
 This confirms that introducing even a light degree of selective pressure yields more reliable search dynamics,
 while fully random selection tends to increase noise and computational cost.
 Another important outcome relates to the local search rate.
 Although local search can refine promising candidates,
 the experiments showed that applying it too frequently becomes counterproductive.
 The lowest tested rate (0.005) offered the best trade-off,
 achieving lower computational cost and greater stability.
 In contrast,
 higher rates (0.03 and 0.05) significantly increased function evaluations without improving success rates.
 This emphasizes the need for careful calibration of exploitation mechanisms in high-dimensional settings.
 Finally,
 when compared to widely used algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms,
 BICCA,
 LSHADE-SPA,
 SHADE-ILS,
 IPSO,
 WOA,
 and DE,
 the proposed method consistently delivered superior performance.
 Taken together,
 these findings highlight the effectiveness of combining structured sampling,
 adaptive weighting,
 selective pressure,
 and controlled local search within Differential Evolution.
 The synergy of these components results in an optimizer that is not only faster but also remarkably stable across different problem types and dimensions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A promising direction for future research is to explore how the proposed framework could be integrated with other well-established metaheuristic algorithms.
 Such a hybridization could leverage the strengths of different search strategies and potentially lead to more effective optimization performance.
 In addition,
 another interesting avenue is the incorporation of learning mechanisms such as reinforcement learning or adaptive parameter-learning techniques so that the algorithm can dynamically adjust its strategies and parameters based on the characteristics of the search landscape.
 Such a self-adaptive system could further enhance the stability,
 robustness,
 and overall efficiency of the optimization process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 this study demonstrates that carefully designed modifications to Differential Evolution can lead to substantial performance gains,
 and it sets the foundation for developing even more powerful and general-purpose optimization algorithms.
