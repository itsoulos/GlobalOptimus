\begin_layout Abstract
BioHealing Optimization (BHO) is a bio-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm that emulates the biological process of injury and recovery.
 Its operation follows a cyclical mechanism comprising three main stages:
 an optional recombination phase,
 an injury phase,
 and a healing phase.
 During recombination,
 elements from the best-known solution are combined with differences drawn from other population members,
 producing candidate solutions that inherit beneficial traits while maintaining diversity.
 The injury phase applies stochastic perturbations to selected dimensions of solutions,
 using either Gaussian-like distributions or heavy-tailed variations,
 thereby promoting exploration of new regions in the search space.
 In the healing phase,
 the altered dimensions are guided gradually toward the current best solution,
 mimicking the progressive restoration of function observed in biological tissues.
 These core mechanisms are enhanced through adaptive strategies,
 including dynamic adjustment of injury intensity and probability,
 a “scar mapping” system that stores directional trends,
 focus on dimensions of higher relevance,
 and the introduction of high-intensity disturbance phases to overcome stagnation.
 The combination of these elements results in a self-regulating search process that maintains a balance between exploration and exploitation,
 enabling effective performance on challenging continuous optimization problems.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Global optimization refers to the task of identifying the global minimum of a real-valued,
 continuous objective function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 ,
 where the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 belongs to a predefined,
 bounded search space 
\begin_inset Formula $S\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The goal is to determine the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{*}∈S$
\end_inset

 such that the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 achieves its lowest possible value over the entire domain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x^{*}=\mbox{arg}\min_{x\in S}f(x).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

:
 is the objective function to be minimized.
 This function can represent a variety of criteria depending on the problem context,
 such as cost,
 loss,
 error,
 potential energy,
 or any other performance metric.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

:
 is the feasible search space,
 a compact subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

,
 meaning it is both closed and bounded.
 Typically,
 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is defined as an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional hyperrectangle (also called a box constraint),
 given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S=\left[a_{1},b_{1}\right]\otimes\left[a_{2},b_{2}\right]\otimes\ldots\left[a_{n},b_{n}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This denotes that each variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is constrained within a finite interval:
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i​}∈[a_{i​},b_{i}​]\text{,for }𝑖=1,2,...,𝑛=\text{1,2,...,}n$
\end_inset

.
 The Cartesian product of these intervals defines the multidimensional region where the search for the global optimum takes place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optimization is one of the most fundamental and widely applied domains of computational intelligence,
 with a vast range of applications in scientific,
 technological,
 and industrial fields.
 Although classical optimization techniques can be effective for small- or medium-scale problems,
 they often fail to deliver satisfactory results when applied to complex,
 nonlinear,
 and high-dimensional environments,
 where issues such as non-convexity,
 high dimensionality,
 and the presence of multiple local optima dominate the search landscape.
 In this context,
 recent years have seen a continuous rise in interest toward metaheuristic methods,
 which offer flexible and stochastic search tools capable of addressing complex optimization problems without requiring derivative information or assumptions of continuity in the solution space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metaheuristic techniques are typically inspired by natural,
 biological,
 social,
 or physical processes,
 aiming to simulate powerful mechanisms for balancing exploration and exploitation within complex search spaces.

 Despite the thematic diversity and creativity of modern bio-inspired metaheuristic techniques,
 many of them continue to face common shortcomings,

 and the absence of documented convergence guarantees

.These limitations underline the need for next-generation algorithms capable of self-regulating their behavior according to the state of the search,
 maintaining stability in convergence,
 and faithfully reflecting the principles and rhythms of complex biological processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BioHealing Optimization (BHO) is positioned within this scientific and technological context,
 drawing inspiration from the regenerative process of wound healing in living organisms.
 Wound healing is a natural function characterized by a delicate balance between disruption and restoration,
 aimed at re-establishing homeostasis.
 BHO translates this biological principle into the optimization domain,
 creating a multi-phase methodology in which each phase has a distinct yet interdependent role.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Injury phase
\series default
:
 Rather than relying on static or simplistic modifications,
 BHO applies stochastic disturbances to selected dimensions of candidate solutions,
 emulating the initial,
 uncontrolled nature of biological injury.
 These disturbances may follow distributions that favor either gentler changes or rare,
 high-impact shifts,
 with their intensity dynamically adapted as the search progresses encouraging broad exploration in the early stages and gradually reducing disruption near convergence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Healing phase
\series default
:
 Subsequently,
 BHO selectively guides the modified dimensions toward the best-known solution,
 in a process that mirrors the progressive restoration of biological tissues.
 This movement is neither mechanical nor fixed;
 the proportion and direction of adjustments are adapted to the search conditions,
 maintaining diversity while also enhancing the exploitation of high-quality solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Recombination phase
\series default
:
 Optionally,
 this process is preceded by an information exchange mechanism inspired by Differential Evolution,
 where components of the best solution are combined with differences from other members of the population.
 This allows the inheritance of strong traits while simultaneously introducing variations that keep the search active.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 such as Wound Healing Based Optimization (WHO)

 and the Synergistic Fibroblast Optimization (SFO)

\end_inset

,
 ,
 while interesting,
 implement more macroscopic models or focus primarily on biological analogies without a clear separation between exploration and exploitation.
 They also do not employ adaptive stochastic perturbations or integrate evolutionary recombination mechanisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast,
 BHO combines stochastic disruption,
 guided restoration,
 and evolutionary recombination into a single,
 flexible architecture that transitions smoothly and self-regulates from exploration to exploitation.
 It further incorporates innovations such as dynamic adjustment of injury and healing probabilities and intensities,
 a “scar mapping” system that retains memory of improvement directions,
 focus on critical dimensions,
 and the introduction of high-intensity disturbance phases to overcome stagnation.
 Together,
 these elements form a methodological proposal that is fundamentally distinct from existing approaches and offers enhanced robustness and performance in demanding,
 high-dimensional optimization problems.

\begin_layout Standard
The core loop of the BHO maintains a population of candidate solutions within box constraints and repeatedly balances broad exploration with guided exploitation.
 It begins by sampling each vector uniformly within the per-dimension bounds,
 evaluating all candidates,
 and designating the incumbent best.
 At every iteration,
 the current elite is identified and the wound intensity follows a monotone decay schedule so that early updates encourage wide exploration while later ones stabilize around promising regions.
 For each non-elite individual,
 an optional Differential Evolution recombination (best/1,
 bin) may combine the incumbent best with a scaled difference of two distinct peers;
 all values are kept feasible through clamping to the bounds.
 The injury phase then applies a per-dimension stochastic disturbance with a specified probability,
 using either Gaussian noise or a Lévy-tailed step produced by a generic stochasticStep() procedure and scaled by the current wound intensity and the variable range,
 feasibility is again enforced by clamping.
 The healing phase gently attracts modified components toward the incumbent best with a specified probability,
 using a step 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 = healStep(
\begin_inset Formula $hr$
\end_inset

) that increases with the healing rate and preserves bounds.
 The resulting trial is evaluated and accepted greedily only if it improves the previous fitness;
 whenever an improvement is accepted,
 the global best is also updated.
 Optionally,
 a lightweight local search may refine non-elite individuals with some probability,
 under the same greedy acceptance rule.
 The procedure terminates upon exhausting either the iteration budget or the cap on function evaluations,
 and returns the pair (
\begin_inset Formula $x_{best}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{best}$
\end_inset

).
 This description captures the clean,
 modular backbone of BHO elite selection,
 optional recombination,
 injury,
 healing,
 and greedy replacement—
while allowing optional extensions to be integrated without altering the fundamental methodology.

\begin_layout Standard
After each successful acceptance (when the new solution improves the previous one),
 Mechanism A updates,
 per dimension,
 a “scar map” that stores two quantities:
 the future probability of wounding and its intensity.
 The update follows the learning rate (scarLR) and is clamped within 
\begin_inset Formula $scar_{pmin}$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $scar_{pmax}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $scar_{smin}$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $scar_{smax}$
\end_inset

.
 When the accepted change moved toward the current best (towardBest_j),
 the adjustment is strengthened so that dimensions that contributed to progress are wounded more often and more purposefully later.
 In parallel,
 the momentum term (
\begin_inset Formula $scarMomentum_{j}$
\end_inset

) keeps a decayed running sign of recent accepted moves (
\begin_inset Formula $signDir_{j}$
\end_inset

) using mom_decay,
 allowing the next stochastic step to lean slightly toward the beneficial direction.
 The dimension score (
\begin_inset Formula $dimScore_{j}$
\end_inset

) rises proportionally to the achieved improvement and later feeds the selection of “hot” dimensions.
 Finally,
 
\begin_inset Formula $bandage_{len}$
\end_inset

 freezes just-improved dimensions for a few iterations,
 protecting the gain from immediate over-disturbance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Integration with the core loop is straightforward:
 Mechanism A runs right after greedy acceptance,
 only when 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{new}$
\end_inset

 < 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{old}$
\end_inset

.
 In subsequent cycles,
 the injury phase no longer uses a single wp but reads the per-dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $woundPdim_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $woundSdim_{j}$
\end_inset

 and,
 where applicable,
 blends the random disturbance with momentum.
 The healing phase remains unchanged,
 while the bandage temporarily prevents new wounds on freshly improved dimensions.
 In this way,
 the core stays clean,
 and the auxiliary structures self-regulate the rate and targeting of exploration on a per-dimension basis.

 These test functions represent a standard suite commonly utilized in the global optimization literature for validating and comparing metaheuristic algorithms.
 Each function exhibits distinct characteristics in terms of modality,
 separability,
 dimensionality,
 and landscape complexity,
 thus providing a robust basis for evaluating the generalization capability of the algorithm.
 Notably,
 the functions were employed in their original,
 unaltered form no additional transformations such as shifting,
 rotation,
 or scaling were applied allowing for a transparent and reproducible comparison with prior studies.

\begin_layout Standard
All experimental procedures were executed on a high-performance computational infrastructure equipped with an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X CPU (16 cores,
 32 threads) and 128 GB of DDR4 RAM,
 running under a Debian Linux environment.
 The evaluation protocol was designed to ensure statistical rigor and reproducibility.
 Specifically,
 each benchmark function was subjected to 30 independent runs,
 with each trial initialized using distinct random seeds to account for stochastic variability in the algorithm’s behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The BioHealingOptimizer and all comparative methods were implemented in highly optimized ANSI C++ code,
 integrated into the GLOBALOPTIMUS optimization framework 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

,
 which is an open-source software environment for metaheuristic experimentation.
 The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/itsoulos/GLOBALOPTIMUS (accessed August 1,
 2025),
 promoting transparency and reproducibility in research.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All algorithmic parameters,
 including those of competing methods,
 are comprehensively outlined in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:settings"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"
nolink "false"

\end_inset

.
 The primary performance metric reported is the average number of objective function evaluations (NFEs) computed over the 30 runs for each test function.
 Additionally,
 success rates defined as the percentage of runs in which the global optimum was successfully located are included in parentheses next to the corresponding mean values.
 In cases where all runs achieved optimal convergence,
 the success rate indicator is omitted for clarity.
 Within the result tables,
 best-performing entries (i.e.,
 those requiring the fewest function evaluations) are visually highlighted in green to facilitate comparison.
