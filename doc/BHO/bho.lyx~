\begin_layout Abstract
BioHealing Optimization (BHO) is a bio-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithm that emulates the biological process of injury and recovery.
 Its operation follows a cyclical mechanism comprising three main stages:
 an optional recombination phase,
 an injury phase,
 and a healing phase.
 During recombination,
 elements from the best-known solution are combined with differences drawn from other population members,
 producing candidate solutions that inherit beneficial traits while maintaining diversity.
 The injury phase applies stochastic perturbations to selected dimensions of solutions,
 using either Gaussian-like distributions or heavy-tailed variations,
 thereby promoting exploration of new regions in the search space.
 In the healing phase,
 the altered dimensions are guided gradually toward the current best solution,
 mimicking the progressive restoration of function observed in biological tissues.
 These core mechanisms are enhanced through adaptive strategies,
 including dynamic adjustment of injury intensity and probability,
 a “scar mapping” system that stores directional trends,
 focus on dimensions of higher relevance,
 and the introduction of high-intensity disturbance phases to overcome stagnation.
 The combination of these elements results in a self-regulating search process that maintains a balance between exploration and exploitation,
 enabling effective performance on challenging continuous optimization problems.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Global optimization refers to the task of identifying the global minimum of a real-valued,
 continuous objective function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 ,
 where the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 belongs to a predefined,
 bounded search space 
\begin_inset Formula $S\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The goal is to determine the point 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{*}∈S$
\end_inset

 such that the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 achieves its lowest possible value over the entire domain:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
x^{*}=\mbox{arg}\min_{x\in S}f(x).
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

:
 is the objective function to be minimized.
 This function can represent a variety of criteria depending on the problem context,
 such as cost,
 loss,
 error,
 potential energy,
 or any other performance metric.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

:
 is the feasible search space,
 a compact subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

,
 meaning it is both closed and bounded.
 Typically,
 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is defined as an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimensional hyperrectangle (also called a box constraint),
 given by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S=\left[a_{1},b_{1}\right]\otimes\left[a_{2},b_{2}\right]\otimes\ldots\left[a_{n},b_{n}\right]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This denotes that each variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is constrained within a finite interval:
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i​}∈[a_{i​},b_{i}​]\text{,for }𝑖=1,2,...,𝑛=\text{1,2,...,}n$
\end_inset

.
 The Cartesian product of these intervals defines the multidimensional region where the search for the global optimum takes place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Optimization is one of the most fundamental and widely applied domains of computational intelligence,
 with a vast range of applications in scientific,
 technological,
 and industrial fields.
 Although classical optimization techniques can be effective for small- or medium-scale problems,
 they often fail to deliver satisfactory results when applied to complex,
 nonlinear,
 and high-dimensional environments,
 where issues such as non-convexity,
 high dimensionality,
 and the presence of multiple local optima dominate the search landscape.
 In this context,
 recent years have seen a continuous rise in interest toward metaheuristic methods,
 which offer flexible and stochastic search tools capable of addressing complex optimization problems without requiring derivative information or assumptions of continuity in the solution space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metaheuristic techniques are typically inspired by natural,
 biological,
 social,
 or physical processes,
 aiming to simulate powerful mechanisms for balancing exploration and exploitation within complex search spaces.

 Despite the thematic diversity and creativity of modern bio-inspired metaheuristic techniques,
 many of them continue to face common shortcomings,

 and the absence of documented convergence guarantees

.These limitations underline the need for next-generation algorithms capable of self-regulating their behavior according to the state of the search,
 maintaining stability in convergence,
 and faithfully reflecting the principles and rhythms of complex biological processes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BioHealing Optimization (BHO) is positioned within this scientific and technological context,
 drawing inspiration from the regenerative process of wound healing in living organisms.
 Wound healing is a natural function characterized by a delicate balance between disruption and restoration,
 aimed at re-establishing homeostasis.
 BHO translates this biological principle into the optimization domain,
 creating a multi-phase methodology in which each phase has a distinct yet interdependent role.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Injury phase
\series default
:
 Rather than relying on static or simplistic modifications,
 BHO applies stochastic disturbances to selected dimensions of candidate solutions,
 emulating the initial,
 uncontrolled nature of biological injury.
 These disturbances may follow distributions that favor either gentler changes or rare,
 high-impact shifts,
 with their intensity dynamically adapted as the search progresses encouraging broad exploration in the early stages and gradually reducing disruption near convergence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Healing phase
\series default
:
 Subsequently,
 BHO selectively guides the modified dimensions toward the best-known solution,
 in a process that mirrors the progressive restoration of biological tissues.
 This movement is neither mechanical nor fixed the proportion and direction of adjustments are adapted to the search conditions,
 maintaining diversity while also enhancing the exploitation of high-quality solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
Recombination phase
\series default
:
 Optionally,
 this process is preceded by an information exchange mechanism inspired by Differential Evolution,
 where components of the best solution are combined with differences from other members of the population.
 This allows the inheritance of strong traits while simultaneously introducing variations that keep the search active.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 such as Wound Healing Based Optimization (WHO)

 and the Synergistic Fibroblast Optimization (SFO)

\end_inset

,
 while interesting,
 implement more macroscopic models or focus primarily on biological analogies without a clear separation between exploration and exploitation.
 They also do not employ adaptive stochastic perturbations or integrate evolutionary recombination mechanisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast,
 BHO combines stochastic disruption,
 guided restoration,
 and evolutionary recombination into a single,
 flexible architecture that transitions smoothly and self-regulates from exploration to exploitation.
 It further incorporates innovations such as dynamic adjustment of injury and healing probabilities and intensities,
 a “scar mapping” system that retains memory of improvement directions,
 focus on critical dimensions,
 and the introduction of high-intensity disturbance phases to overcome stagnation.
 Together,
 these elements form a methodological proposal that is fundamentally distinct from existing approaches and offers enhanced robustness and performance in demanding,
 high-dimensional optimization problems.

\begin_layout Standard
The core loop of the BHO maintains a population of candidate solutions within box constraints and repeatedly balances broad exploration with guided exploitation.
 It begins by sampling each vector uniformly within the per-dimension bounds,
 evaluating all candidates,
 and designating the incumbent best.
 At every iteration,
 the current elite is identified and the wound intensity follows a monotone decay schedule so that early updates encourage wide exploration while later ones stabilize around promising regions.
 For each non-elite individual,
 an optional Differential Evolution recombination (best/1,
 bin) may combine the incumbent best with a scaled difference of two distinct peers all values are kept feasible through clamping to the bounds.
 The injury phase then applies a per-dimension stochastic disturbance with a specified probability,
 using either Gaussian noise or a Lévy-tailed step produced by a generic stochasticStep() procedure and scaled by the current wound intensity and the variable range,
 feasibility is again enforced by clamping.
 The healing phase gently attracts modified components toward the incumbent best with a specified probability,
 using a step 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 = healStep(
\begin_inset Formula $h_{r}$
\end_inset

) that increases with the healing rate and preserves bounds.
 The resulting trial is evaluated and accepted greedily only if it improves the previous fitness whenever an improvement is accepted,
 the global best is also updated.
 The procedure terminates upon exhausting either the iteration budget or the cap on function evaluations,
 and returns the pair (
\begin_inset Formula $x_{best}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{best}$
\end_inset

).
 This description captures the clean,
 modular backbone of BHO elite selection,
 optional recombination,
 injury,
 healing,
 and greedy replacement while allowing optional extensions to be integrated without altering the fundamental methodology.

Integration of adaptive mechanisms into the BHO core loop

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The integration of the extensions into the BHO core loop follows the method’s natural flow without altering its backbone.
 After initialization and before processing individuals in each iteration,
 the algorithm updates stagnation status and configures any exploration bursts at this point a targeted micro-restart around the incumbent best may also be triggered when lack of improvement persists.
 In the same pre-loop stage,
 the per-dimension importance scores are decayed and the current hot set is selected so that subsequent perturbations are preferentially strengthened where recent gains have been observed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the heart of the iteration,
 immediately before applying stochastic disturbances,
 the noise generator is determined:
 the random step may use a heavy-tailed Mantegna draw to allow rare long jumps or fall back to Gaussian noise,
 depending on settings.
 The injury phase then exploits the hot-dimension priorities,
 the multiplicative burst effects when RAGE or Hyper-RAGE windows are active,
 and a mild intensity boost when early stagnation is detected.
 The random step is gently biased toward the recent momentum direction of each coordinate through a dedicated bias coefficient,
 while bandage protection can be bypassed only during bursts so as not to throttle exploration.
 Immediately after the standard injuries,
 a targeted Alpha-Strike may rarely fire on a few coordinates,
 scaled by variable ranges and current wound strength,
 before control passes to healing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The healing phase is modulated so that,
 during bursts,
 the restorative rate is temporarily reduced to avoid erasing exploration,
 followed by a short cooldown with amplified healing to smooth the return to stabilization.
 Optionally,
 while bursts are active,
 selected components may be copied from the incumbent best to inject direction without sacrificing diversity.
 Acceptance remains greedy,
 and only upon true improvement are the scar-map learning states updated:
 the per-dimension wounding probabilities and strengths,
 momentum,
 importance scores,
 and bandage.
 These updates feed the next injury cycle,
 conveying where and how stronger or more frequent disturbances are worthwhile.
 When no improvement occurs,
 the distance since last best increases and can re-trigger soft boosts,
 bursts,
 or,
 if needed,
 micro-restarts at the beginning of the next iteration.
 In this way,
 the mechanisms are woven into injury,
 healing,
 and their transitions,
 while preserving the clean core architecture of elite selection,
 recombination,
 disturbance,
 restoration,
 and greedy replacement.

\begin_layout Standard
After each successful acceptance (when the new solution improves the previous one),
 Mechanism A updates,
 per dimension,
 a “scar map” that stores two quantities:
 the future probability of wounding and its intensity.
 The update follows the learning rate (
\begin_inset Formula $scarLR$
\end_inset

) and is clamped within 
\begin_inset Formula $scar_{pmin}$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $scar_{pmax}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $scar_{smin}$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $scar_{smax}$
\end_inset

.
 When the accepted change moved toward the current best (
\begin_inset Formula $towardBest_{j}$
\end_inset

),
 the adjustment is strengthened so that dimensions that contributed to progress are wounded more often and more purposefully later.
 In parallel,
 the momentum term (
\begin_inset Formula $scarMomentum_{j}$
\end_inset

) keeps a decayed running sign of recent accepted moves (
\begin_inset Formula $signDir_{j}$
\end_inset

) using mom_decay,
 allowing the next stochastic step to lean slightly toward the beneficial direction.
 The dimension score (
\begin_inset Formula $dimScore_{j}$
\end_inset

) rises proportionally to the achieved improvement and later feeds the selection of “hot” dimensions.
 Finally,
 
\begin_inset Formula $bandage_{len}$
\end_inset

 freezes just-improved dimensions for a few iterations,
 protecting the gain from immediate over-disturbance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Integration with the core loop is straightforward:
 Mechanism A runs right after greedy acceptance,
 only when 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{new}$
\end_inset

 < 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{old}$
\end_inset

.
 In subsequent cycles,
 the injury phase no longer uses a single wp but reads the per-dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $woundPdim_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $woundSdim_{j}$
\end_inset

 and,
 where applicable,
 blends the random disturbance with momentum.
 The healing phase remains unchanged,
 while the bandage temporarily prevents new wounds on freshly improved dimensions.
 In this way,
 the core stays clean,
 and the auxiliary structures self-regulate the rate and targeting of exploration on a per-dimension basis.

 From the updated scores,
 the top

 During the injury phase,
 if a coordinate is in hot,
 its base wounding probability

 is amplified and the disturbance intensity scale is also increased.
 This gently shifts the balance toward components of the search space that have proven effective,

This mechanism draws heavy-tailed random steps to enable rare,
 long jumps that help escape local minima.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $levyAlpha$
\end_inset

 parameter controls tail heaviness (lower values yield more frequent large jumps),
 while 
\begin_inset Formula $levyScale$
\end_inset

 sets the step magnitude.
 The constant 
\begin_inset Formula $levySigmaU$
\end_inset

 is precomputed (Mantegna scheme),
 and levyStep() samples two Gaussian variables to return a Lévy-type increment.
 The stochasticStep() then switches between Lévy and standard Gaussian noise,
 allowing the Injury phase to mix aggressive exploration with steadier local moves,
 with feasibility preserved via clamping.

 along the momentum sign (momentumSign derived from scarMomentum_j),
 or randomly when diversification is desired.
 All updates are modulated by the current wound intensity ws and clamped to the feasible bounds.

 keeping the move rare yet highly impactful without disrupting the algorithm’s core cadence

 a gentle,
 targeted restart is triggered on a small fraction of the population.

 is selected (always excluding the elite),
 and for each,
 a candidate is sampled near the current

 Values are clamped to the bounds and evaluated,
 improvements are accepted greedily and the global best is updated if necessary.

This mechanism dynamically tunes the healing rate so exploration remains effective during bursts and stabilization accelerates immediately afterward.
 The base hr is copied to hrate,
 which is temporarily reduced whenever either burst timer is active (
\begin_inset Formula $rageTimer$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $hyperTimer$
\end_inset

) via 
\begin_inset Formula $healRageReduce$
\end_inset

.
 Once bursts end,
 a short cooldown window controlled by cooldown boosts healing using healPostCool until the counter reaches zero.
 At each step,
 the healing increment is computed as 
\begin_inset Formula $alpha$
\end_inset

 = healStep(
\begin_inset Formula $hrate$
\end_inset

) and applied through applyHealingWith(
\begin_inset Formula $alpha$

 When a burst ends (

\end_inset

),
 
\begin_inset Formula $cooldown$
\end_inset

 is set to 
\begin_inset Formula $cooldownLen$
\end_inset

 ensuring a smooth transition from aggressive exploration to controlled exploitation without abrupt shifts in the algorithm’s behavior.

This mechanism triggers when the stagnation counter 
\begin_inset Formula $sinceBest$
\end_inset

 exceeds a mild threshold (
\begin_inset Formula $stagnThrSoft$
\end_inset

).
 A boost factor 
\begin_inset Formula $woundBoost$
\end_inset

 above one is then computed using a scaled function of the excess over the threshold and the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $stagnBoost$
\end_inset

.
 The factor multiplies the injury intensity in the subsequent Injury step,
 briefly deepening disturbances without changing probabilities or invoking aggressive bursts (RAGE/Hyper-RAGE).
 Once stagnation subsides,
 
\begin_inset Formula $woundBoost$
\end_inset

 returns to 1,
 restoring the normal intensity.
 The boost is applied before per-dimension modifiers and respects bounds via clamping,
 providing a gentle push for exploration without abrupt shifts in behavior.

 These test functions represent a standard suite commonly utilized in the global optimization literature for validating and comparing metaheuristic algorithms.
 Each function exhibits distinct characteristics in terms of modality,
 separability,
 dimensionality,
 and landscape complexity,
 thus providing a robust basis for evaluating the generalization capability of the algorithm.
 Notably,
 the functions were employed in their original,
 unaltered form no additional transformations such as shifting,
 rotation,
 or scaling were applied allowing for a transparent and reproducible comparison with prior studies.

All experimental procedures were executed on a high-performance computational infrastructure equipped with an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X CPU (16 cores,
 32 threads) and 128 GB of DDR4 RAM,
 running under a Debian Linux environment.
 The evaluation protocol was designed to ensure statistical rigor and reproducibility.
 Specifically,
 each benchmark function was subjected to 30 independent runs,
 with each trial initialized using distinct random seeds to account for stochastic variability in the algorithm’s behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The BioHealingOptimizer and all comparative methods were implemented in highly optimized ANSI C++ code,
 integrated into the GLOBALOPTIMUS optimization framework

,
 which is an open-source software environment for metaheuristic experimentation.
 The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/itsoulos/GLOBALOPTIMUS (accessed August 1,

 promoting transparency and reproducibility in research.

All algorithmic parameters,
 including those of competing methods,

 and

.
 The primary performance metric reported is the average number of objective function evaluations (NFEs) computed over the 30 runs for each test function.
 Additionally,
 success rates defined as the percentage of runs in which the global optimum was successfully located are included in parentheses next to the corresponding mean values.
 In cases where all runs achieved optimal convergence,
 the success rate indicator is omitted for clarity.
 Within the result tables,
 best-performing entries (i.e.,
 those requiring the fewest function evaluations) are visually highlighted in green to facilitate comparison.

\begin_layout Standard
On synthetic and physical potentials,
 BHO delivers particularly strong best values nearly zero error on Parameter Estimation for Frequency-Modulated Sound Waves and attains the lowest best value on the Lennard-Jones Potential however,
 for the mean on Lennard-Jones,
 jDE leads and CMA-ES follows,
 indicating that classical,
 Gaussian-driven strategies remain very stable when the landscape exhibits symmetric curvature.
 On the Tersoff Potential for model Si (B) and Tersoff Potential for model Si (C) the picture shifts:
 for Si (B) the best mean comes from EA4Eig with CMA-ES close behind,
 while UDE3 secures the best best for Si (C),
 EA4Eig has the best best and CMA-ES the best mean.
 Overall,
 advanced DE variants with stronger recombination (EA4Eig,
 UDE3) and CMA-ES alternate at the top,
 which aligns with the literature on rough but moderately structured landscapes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In electro-economic and industrial test cases the pattern diverges in informative ways.
 On Electricity Transmission Pricing,
 BHO attains the lowest best,
 whereas UDE3 achieves the best mean suggesting BHO can hit excellent extremes while UDE3 maintains consistently low performance across runs.
 In Dynamic Economic Dispatch 1 and Dynamic Economic Dispatch 2,
 CMA-ES dominates the first on both best and mean,
 confirming its strength on smooth,
 nearly quadratic geometries,
 while in the second BHO records the lowest mean and EA4Eig the best best,
 indicating that BHO’s injury–healing dynamics act as a variance-damping safety net.
 Across the static dispatch family the results are mixed:
 in StaticEconomic Load Dispatch 1 the best best is from mLSHADE_RL and the best mean from EA4Eig in Static Economic Load Dispatch 2 mLSHADE_RL yields the lowest mean (with EA4Eig taking the best best) in Static Economic Load Dispatch 4 mLSHADE_RL again takes the best best while EA4Eig leads on mean.
 Static Economic Load Dispatch 3 shows practical ties around the same value and is not very discriminative.
 Static Economic Load Dispatch 15 contains a notable outlier where BHO’s mean is orders of magnitude lower than others this merits independent verification,
 such as re-running experiments or checking units,
 because the unusually large gap likely signals a scaling difference or an unexpected effect.

\begin_layout Standard
On more “classic” comparative tests,
 CMA-ES shows impressive robustness on smooth,
 well-scaled landscapes:
 beyond Dynamic Economic Dispatch 1,
 it also holds both best and mean on Spread Spectrum Radar Polly phase Code Design.
 EA4Eig stands out when strong anisotropy or correlation matters Circular Antenna Array Design is topped by EA4Eig on both best and mean consistent with its eigen-crossover design.
 UDE3 performs very well on problems with additional structure or constraints,
 such as the mean on Electricity Transmission Pricing,
 matching its remit as a unified DE for constrained scenarios.
 mLSHADE_RL frequently attains best-case wins in StaticEconomic Load Dispatch 1 and Static Economic Load Dispatch 4 and remains competitive on mean across several cases,
 underscoring the value of ensemble mutation plus restarts on fractured landscapes.
 SaDE,
 while a solid baseline,
 tends to trail the newer DE descendants,
 and CLPSO underperforms in most tables expected where anisotropy demands directional information beyond standard swarm velocity updates.
 jDE remains competitive on certain physical potentials,
 for example the mean on Lennard-Jones,
 but shows larger dispersion on industrial dispatch tasks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On flat or near-flat landscapes Bifunctional Catalyst Blend Optimal Control,
 Transmission Network Expansion Planning,
 and essentially Optimal Control of a Non-Linear Stirred Tank Reactor where differences are on the order of 1e-10 all methods tie or are practically indistinguishable,
 so these tests add little diagnostic power.
 In sum,
 there is no single winner:
 CMA-ES is the reference choice for smooth,
 well-conditioned cases and remains very strong on mean performance EA4Eig excels where alignment with principal variance directions helps UDE3 often wins on mean under constrained or pricing structure mLSHADE_RL frequently takes best-case wins on difficult static dispatch variants and BHO shows top best values on several critical functions and competitive means in demanding settings,
 indicating an effective exploration-to-exploitation transition.

\begin_layout Standard
The evaluation distinguishes peak performance (“best”) from reliability (“mean”) over seventeen problems.
 Summing per-function ranks gives BHO the lowest totals in both views (best:
 47,
 mean:
 48) and therefore the best overall score (overall:
 95,
 average rank:
 2.794).
 UDE3 follows at close range (best/mean:
 51/54,
 overall:
 105,
 average rank:
 3.088).
 EA4Eig and mLSHADE_RL form the next tier with near-equal totals (112 and 113,
 average ranks:
 3.294 and 3.323).
 CMA-ES sits mid-pack (overall:
 125,
 average rank:
 3.676),
 SaDE trails it (overall:
 137,
 average rank:
 4.029),
 while CLPSO and jDE rank lowest overall (overall:
 189 and 198,
 average ranks:
 5.558 and 5.823),
 reflecting consistently higher placements across most functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The detailed “best” table shows BHO frequently taking first place on demanding tasks (e.g.,
 Parameter Estimation for Frequency-Modulated Sound Waves,
 Lennard–Jones Potential,
 Electricity Transmission Pricing),
 indicating strong exploration and high upside.
 UDE3 records many top-three finishes and several wins,
 especially where structure/constraints are prominent,
 explaining its overall second place and good generalization.
 EA4Eig and mLSHADE_RL trade advantages on anisotropic or fractured landscapes (e.g.,
 Tersoff Si(B)/Si(C),
 Static Economic Load Dispatch),
 consistent with eigen-guided recombination in the former and ensemble mutation with restarts in the latter.
 CMA-ES shows the expected resilience on smooth,
 well-conditioned geometries:
 its mean rank is often better than its best rank,
 a sign of low variance rather than aggressive extremes.
 SaDE remains a sturdy baseline but lags newer DE descendants.
 CLPSO underperforms (typical under strong anisotropy).
 jDE exhibits occasional peaks but larger dispersion,
 which inflates its ranks in both best and mean.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contrasting best and mean exposes consistency:
 BHO’s lead in best does not come at the expense of reliability its mean total is also the lowest so top outcomes are not isolated “lucky” runs.
 Likewise,
 UDE3’s small best–mean gap indicates stable performance across repeats.
 EA4Eig and mLSHADE_RL display complementary behaviors (alignment with principal directions for the former,
 collective mutations and restarts for the latter).
 CMA-ES often “wins” on mean where smoothness enforces small fluctuations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three problems are practically non-discriminative:
 in Bifunctional Catalyst Blend Optimal Control and Transmission Network Expansion Planning all methods tie,
 and in Optimal Control of a Non-Linear Stirred Tank Reactor differences are negligible.
 These dilute separability without altering the final ordering.
 By contrast,
 problems such as Electricity Transmission Pricing and the Dynamic/Static Economic Load Dispatch families yield substantive differences that drive the clear BHO–UDE3 lead and the tight EA4Eig–mLSHADE_RL contest for third–fourth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In summary,
 with a fixed budget of 1.5×10^5 evaluations,
 BHO is the strongest overall method on both peak and average performance,
 UDE3 follows closely with high consistency,
 EA4Eig and mLSHADE_RL come very close behind,
 leveraging different mechanisms.
 CMA-ES remains a reliable reference baseline,
 while SaDE,
 CLPSO,
 and jDE underperform under the present conditions.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This work introduces BioHealing Optimization (BHO),
 a population‐based metaheuristic that integrates stochastic “injury,” guided “healing” toward the incumbent best,
 and an optional DE(best/1,bin) recombination step,
 augmented by adaptive,
 per-dimension mechanisms (scar map and momentum,
 hot-dimension focusing,
 RAGE/Hyper-RAGE bursts,
 Lévy steps,
 and healing modulation).
 The resulting architecture self-regulates exploration and exploitation without altering the core loop of elite selection,
 recombination,
 disturbance,
 greedy acceptance,
 and restoration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental protocol used 30 independent runs per problem with a fixed budget of 
\begin_inset Formula $1.5\cdot10^{5}$
\end_inset

 function evaluations and a harmonized parameter disclosure across all compared methods.
 Rank aggregation over 17 problems separates peak performance (best of runs) from reliability (mean of runs).
 Under this protocol,
 BHO attains the lowest total rank in both views (best:
 47,
 mean:
 48),
 yielding the top combined score (overall:
 95,
 average rank:
 2.794).
 The next methods are UDE3 (overall:
 105),
 EA4Eig (112),
 and mLSHADE_RL (113),
 followed by CMA-ES,
 SaDE,
 CLPSO,
 and jDE.
 These results indicate that BHO combines high upside with consistent average performance across repetitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Per-problem observations are consistent with the aggregated ranking.
 BHO frequently secures first place on demanding tasks such as parameter estimation for frequency-modulated sound waves,
 Lennard–Jones potential,
 and electricity transmission pricing,
 reflecting an effective transition from exploration to exploitation.
 UDE3 performs strongly where structural constraints are prominent EA4Eig excels when alignment with principal variance directions matters mLSHADE_RL often achieves leading “best” values on difficult static dispatch cases and CMA-ES remains a dependable reference on smooth,
 well-conditioned landscapes.
 Some benchmarks bifunctional catalyst control and transmission network expansion planning,
 as well as the stirred-tank reactor with differences on the order of 1e−10 are effectively non-discriminative and do not affect the overall ordering.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Overall,
 within the stated evaluation budget and set of problems,
 BHO achieves the best combined ranking among strong baselines without dominating every individual case.
 The evidence supports that the combination of stochastic injury,
 guided healing,
 and DE-style recombination enriched with adaptive,
 per-dimension controls is an effective strategy for challenging continuous optimization,
 with performance that is competitive in both best-case and mean outcomes.
 Interpretation of the results should account for the problem characteristics (smoothness,
 anisotropy,
 constraints) and the fixed evaluation budget used here.

Future Research Directions
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
BioHealing Optimization (BHO) couples a DE(best/1,
 bin) recombination path with a disturbance–restoration dynamic stochastic injury plus guided healing augmented by per-dimension controllers (scar map and momentum,
 hot-dimension focusing,
 RAGE/Hyper-RAGE bursts,
 Lévy steps,
 healing modulation).
 From this architecture and the reported evidence,
 several technically grounded avenues follow.
 Convergence under nonstationary stochastic dynamics can be tightened via a nonhomogeneous Markov view on the extended state (population,
 incumbent best,
 scar/momentum/bandage),
 establishing drift/minorization under decaying injury,
 and clarifying when heavy-tailed Lévy perturbations speed basin escape without harming late-stage stability.
 Mechanism-level attribution is enabled by budget-matched ablations with nonparametric inference (Friedman,
 Nemenyi,
 Wilcoxon with effect sizes),
 isolating when RAGE,
 hot-dims,
 or Lévy dominate across smooth,
 ill-conditioned,
 multimodal,
 or constrained regimes.
 Endogenous control of (
\begin_inset Formula $w_{s}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{p}$
\end_inset

,
 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{r}$
\end_inset

),
 RAGE triggers,
 and hot-dim boosts can use bandit/feedback policies (and classic DE/ES self-adaptation for 
\begin_inset Formula $F,$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $CR$
\end_inset

) to reduce hyperparameter sensitivity.
 High-dimensional scaling motivates subspace search,
 scar-weighted directions,
 and lightweight preconditioning (diagonal/low-rank) for partial rotational invariance.
 Constraints,
 noise,
 and nonstationarity can be handled by projection/prox in healing,
 noise-robust acceptance and budget-aware re-evaluation,
 and change-detector-driven RAGE activation.
 Hybridization with cheap,
 bound-aware local moves and straightforward parallelism (GPU,
 island models sharing elites and scar/hot-dim information) can raise evaluation efficiency.
 Broader benchmarking with budget sweeps and invariance-rich families (e.g.,
 BBOB) would map where BHO excels,
 where UDE-type or CMA-ES baselines prevail,
 and where hybrids are preferable.
 Finally,
 healing admits a contractive/proximal interpretation,
 while injury with decaying variance resembles annealing;
 scar momentum acts as a signed,
 exponentially weighted directional prior.
 These directions remain within BHO’s current envelope,
 aiming at provable properties,
 clear attribution of gains,
 robustness in practical settings,
 and scalable performance.
