\begin_layout Abstract
A significant number of applications from many research areas can be considered
 global optimization problems, such as applications in the area of image
 processing, medical informatics, economic models, etc.
 This paper presents a programming tool written in ANSI C++, which researchers
 can use to formulate the problem to be solved and then make use of the
 local and global optimization methods provided by this tool to efficiently
 solve such problems.
 The main features of the suggested software are: a) Coding of the objective
 problem in a high level language such as ANSI C++ b) Incorporation of many
 global optimization techniques to tackle the objective problem c)Parameterizati
on of global optimization methods using user-defined parameters.

However, in most cases, global optimization methods require a lot of computing
 resources to implement both in memory and computing time.
 Because of the large demands that global optimization methods have on computing

In this paper, a new integrated computing environment for performing global
 optimization methods for multidimensional functions is presented and analyzed
 in detail.
 In this computing environment, the programmer can code the problem to be
 solved using a high-level programming language such as C++.
 In addition to the objective function, the programmer can also provide
 information that the objective problem should have at the start of the
 optimization process and, in addition, can formulate a series of actions
 that will take place after the optimization process is finished.
 Subsequently, the researcher can formulate a strategy to solve the problem.
 In this strategy, the researcher can choose from a series of sampling methods,
 choose a global minimization method established in the relevant literature
 and possibly some local minimization method to improve the produced result.
 Similar software environments can be found, such as the BARON software
 package 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 for non-convex optimization problems, the MERLIN optimization software

, used mainly for online optimization.
 In the proposed software, the user can write the required objective function
 in simple C++ and then choose from a wide range of global optimization
 methods, the most suitable one for finding the global minimum.
 Furthermore, in the proposed software, the user can parameterize the local
 minimization method to be used as well as the termination method to be
 used for the successful termination of the technique.
 In addition, it is possible for the user to create his own global minimization
 method from scratch using the programming tools of the Optimus libraries.

 The researcher should code the objective function and a number of other
 mandatory functions in the C++ programming language.
 Also, the researcher should provide the dimension of the objective function

Implemented global optimization methods 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following, the global optimization methods present in the proposed
 software are presented.
 In most of them, a local optimization method is applied after their end
 in order to find the global minimum with greater reliability.
 In the proposed software, each implemented global optimization method has
 a set of parameters that can determine the global optimization path and
 the effectiveness of the method.
 For example, the genetic algorithm contains parameters such as the number
 of chromosomes or the maximum number of generations allowed.
 In addition, to make the optimization process easier, each method has been
 assigned a symbolic name, such as pso for particle swarm optimization.
 The implemented global optimization methods are:

 global minimum of the function, which is -2.
 However, with the help of the local optimization method applied after its

To assess the ability of the software package to adapt to different problems,
 a series of experiments were performed under different conditions.
 In the first series of experiments, different global optimization techniques
 were applied to a series of objective functions that one can locate in
 the relevant literature.
 In the second series of experiments, the proposed software was applied
 to a difficult problem from the field of chemistry, that of finding the
 minimum potential energy of N interacting atoms of molecules.
 In the third set of experiments, the scaling of the required number of
 function calls was evaluated with a parallel technique applied to a difficult
 problem from the global optimization space, where the problem dimension
 was constantly increasing.
 In the fourth set of experiments, the genetic algorithm was utilized for
 the interface Fuchs-Kliewer polaritons.
 In the final set of experiments, different sampling techniques were incorporate
d for the used genetic algorithm.

 local minima in the specified range.
 During the conducted experiments the values

 were used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiments were performed using the above objective functions and ran
 30 times using a different seed for the random number generator each time.
 During the execution of the experiments, the genetic algorithm (Genetic
 method) was used as a global optimizer in two versions: one without a local
 optimization method and one with periodic application of the bfgs method
 at a rate of 5% on the chromosomes in every generation.
 The execution parameters for the genetic algorithm are listed in Table
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Experimental-settings"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The experimental results for the two variants of the genetic algorithm
 are listed in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:results"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The numbers in cells denote average function calls for the 30 independent
 runs.
 The numbers in parentheses show the percentage of finding the global minimum
 in the 30 runs.
 If this number is absent, it means that the algorithm discovered the global
 minimum in all 30 executions.
 In this table, the line SUM represents the sum of the function calls.
 The experimental results indicate that the usage of a local search method
 in combination with the genetic algorithm significantly reduces the required
 number of average function calls and also improves the reliability of the
 method in finding the global minimum.
 Of course, periodically applying a local minimization method to some of
 the chromosomes drastically increases the required execution time, but
 the large reduction in the total number of calls required is a big advantage
 of its application.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 is used as a test case here.
 The function to be minimized is given by:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
V_{LJ}(r)=4\epsilon\left[\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12}-\left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{6}\right]\label{eq:potential}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For testing purposes, the method iPSO of the package was applied to the
 above problem for a variety of number of atoms and the results are shown
 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:potential"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 This method was experimentally compared with the genetic algorithm.
 In all cases, the number of chromosomes (or particles) was set to 200 and
 the maximum number of allowed iterations was set to 200.
 As can be seen from the experimental results, the method iPSO requires
 a significantly reduced number of function calls compared to genetic algorithm,
 while its reliability in finding the global minimum for the potential remains
 high even when the number of atoms participating in the potential increases
 significantly.

Parallel optimization

The High Conditioned Elliptic function, defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(10^{6}\right)^{\frac{i-1}{n-1}}x_{i}^{2}
\]

\end_inset

 is used as a test case to measure the scalability of the parallel global
 optimization technique denoted as ParallelDe.
 This method was applied to the problem with dimension increasing from 2
 to 20 and for a different number of processing threads.
 The experimental results are shown in diagram form in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Scalability"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

.
 As one observes from the figure, the number of calls required to find the
 global minimum decreases as the total processing threads increase, although
 the problem becomes increasingly difficult with increasing dimension.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this work, an environment for executing global optimization problems
 was presented.
 In this environment, the user can code the objective problem using some
 predefined functions and then has the possibility to choose one among several
 global optimization methods to solve the mentioned problem.
 In addition, it is given the possibility to choose to use some local optimizati
on method to enhance the reliability of the produced results.
 This programming environment is freely available and easy to extend to
 accommodate more global optimization techniques.
 It is subject to continuous improvements and some of those planned for
 the near future are:
